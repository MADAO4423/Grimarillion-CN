Alex
Mrs. Constance says I'm not supposed to talk to you.
Why is that?
Cause you have evil in your tummy.
I see.
Sorry kiddo, just a quick question. Know anything about Tendo? There was a weird ghost guy here a while ago.
Oh, that spooky guy? He had evil in his tummy too...{^n}{^n}*Alex shudders visibly*{^n}{^n}Yeah, he went towards the rift gate over there. Behind it, there's a little boat that will take you to a cozy hideout, I think he said he was going there.
Sorry to bother you little guy.
Alright then.
