#LICH
tagDDSkillClassDescription01=The Lich walks the thin line between life and death, channeling forbidden power to transcend mortal limits. Unlike Necromancers who rely on minions, Liches transform their own bodies into terrifying forms, embodying death's icy grasp and the void's corruption.

#ILLUSIONIST
tagDDSkillClassDescription02=Feared for their mastery of both weapon and sorcery, Illusionists weave steel and spell into a seamless dance of deception and destruction. Unlike brutish warriors or scholarly mages, they strike with a weapon wreathed in phantom fire, feint with illusions, and cloud the minds of their foes before delivering a final, fatal stroke.

tagDDClass02SkillDescription03A=^b[Spell] [Movement] [Disengage]^n^n^wThe Arcanum Nihilus taught that true mastery lies not in facing danger, but in rewriting its rules.
