tagClass20SkillDescription2017=^ZRiftstalker + Evocator{^n}^o[Modifier to Stormcaller]^n^wThe lesser magics of the world were easily capable of being manipulated to fabricate that of the rifts. Doing so was an unstable process, however, and to interrupt it would be unwise. ^n^rRequires 32 points in Evocator and at least one point in Riftstalker.
tagClass20SkillName2018=Disruptor Protocol
tagClass20SkillDescription2018=^ZRiftstalker + Outrider{^n}^o[Modifier to Flak Blast]^n^wIt was not especially uncommon for Riftstalkers to strike out on their own. It is much more common nowadays, since the fall of the RIP. Those that have survived in the wilds have grown stronger and more experienced for it. ^n^rRequires 32 points in Outrider and at least one point in Riftstalker.
tagClass20SkillName2019=Skirmisher Protocol
tagClass20SkillDescription2019=^ZRiftstalker + Champion{^n}^o[Modifier to Battery]^n^wChampions were already more or less unstoppable. When some heard tales of the power to control the mobility of the world around them, it was only a matter of time before they would be moving heaven and earth to slay their foes. ^n^rRequires 32 points in Champion and at least one point in Riftstalker.
tagClass20SkillName2021=Pursuer Protocol
tagClass20SkillDescription2021=^ZRiftstalker + the Necrotic{^n}^o[Modifier to Unholy Hailfire]^n^wNothing quite so evil as tearing a hole in reality to unleash a bunch of unholy exploding meteors from beyond the veil of the Rift, is there? ^n^rRequires 32 points in Necrotic and at least one point in Riftstalker.

tagSkillClassName21=Necrotic
tagSkillClassDescription21=We are at the end of the world. There are no longer tales of right and wrong. The Chthonians and Aetherials have robbed us of our humanity, but there were those of us before them that lacked such a trait already. I have told you of the horrific powers of the Terror Knights from the Obsidian Forests. I have described the magnificent displays put forth by Evocators throughout Enolis. You have learned of the Riftstalkers and their RIP program, of the gladitorial masters known to us as Champions of mankind. You have caught wind of the elusive Outriders, assassins not of blade, but of bullet. Now I will tell you the story not of a group of people, but of one creature composed purely of malevolence. The Grim Dawn killed many beasts, but could not remove The Necrotic from Cairn. ^n^sCreated by Ceno for the Zenith Mod, updated by Asylum101

tagClass21SkillName01A=Reaper's Glare
tagClass21SkillDescription01A=^b[Channeled] [Spell] [Ranged] [Chaining]^n^n^wI first met the Necrotic on the fields of Edheren, where I learned its quest for power had given it the ability to directly siphon life from its foes at will.{^n}^oThis skill must be channeled to maintain its effect.
tagClass21SkillName01B=Bonds of the Broken
tagClass21SkillDescription01B=Within its view, there was no escape from the monstrous cruelty of the Necrotic.
tagClass21SkillName01C=Reign of Chaos
tagClass21SkillDescription01C=^b[Secondary Modifier] [Fragmenting] [AOE]^n^n^wAs it siphoned more and more power into its being, the Necrotic was eventually capable of covering the fields of Edheren in an onslaught of chaotic energies. Only those which were Primordials survived. 

tagClass21SkillName02A=Claws of the Beast
tagClass21SkillDescription02A=^b[Spell] [Multiple Projectiles] [Penetrating]^n^n^wThe Necrotic possessed a full control over a tormented being which I can only describe as 'the Beast'. When not wanting to get its own hands dirty, the Necrotic would instead ravage enemies within the grasp of this creature.
tagClass21SkillName02B=Eldritch Torment
tagClass21SkillDescription02B=^b[Modifier] [AOE] [Multiple Projectiles]^n^n^wWhile pitiable, the Beast was no less malevolent than its Necrotic master. 

tagClass21SkillName03A=Malice
tagClass21SkillDescription03A=^b[Passive]^n^n^wThe wickedness of the vile Necrotic knew no bounds.

tagClass21SkillName04A=Necrotic Shade
tagClass21SkillDescription04A=^b[Passive]^n^n^wThe Necrotic may act like a feral animal, but it is not ignorant. It is self-aware enough to know that its malevolence would earn it some enemies, and so it created some formidable defenses about its being.

tagClass21SkillName05A=Leech Grenade
tagClass21SkillDescription05A=^b[Spell] [Grenade] [AOE]^n^n^wThey had intended to study it. But the Necrotic had other plans when it first ran into the Black Legion. The engagement was swift and merciless, and the Necrotic emerged with a great knowledge of the alchemical weapons of the Legion. As the Necrotic had poured its powers over their weapons in the form of an unholy grenade, the Luminari decided to start collecting new armaments of its own to combat the beast. They have not yet succeeded.
tagClass21SkillName05B=Necrotic Suffusion
tagClass21SkillDescription05B=^b[Modifier] [Fragmenting] [AOE]^n^n^wA material weapon served little use to the Necrotic, however; it, therefore, chose to pull powers from the Eldritch planes to torment a wider array of foes.

tagClass21SkillName06A=Primordial Transfer
tagClass21SkillDescription06A=^b[Spell] [AOE] [Timed] [Debuff]^n^n^wThe Necrotic, like a leech, stole not merely its adversaries' life force, but also the very fabric tethering them to the astral or physical realms, empowering itself in the process.

tagClass21SkillName07A=Obsidian Tremors
tagClass21SkillDescription07A=^b[Spell] [Wave]^n^n^wI do not believe the Necrotic inherently has an allegiance to Ch'thon, but it does have a control over the obsidian which Chthonians draw their power from. In some instances, the Necrotic has buried armies underneath mountains of the stygian stone.
tagClass21SkillName07X=Fleeting Obsidian
tagClass21SkillDescription07X=^b[Transmuter]^n^n^wThe Necrotic traditionally put a great deal of focus into its spells to turn them into magnificent displays of widespread destruction, but it could, with the loss of this focus, put out lesser versions of these cruelties on a whim.
tagClass21SkillName07B=From the Earth, Poison
tagClass21SkillDescription07B=^b[Modifier]^n^n^wAs the obsidian shrapnel flew out from the ground, it brought with it the virulent malevolency of the Beast beneath the surface.

tagClass21SkillName08A=Defender of Death
tagClass21SkillDescription08=^b[Exclusive] [Buff]^n^n^wFor a creature so proficient at causing disaster, the Necrotic proved equally capable of prolonging life for the sake of death.

tagClass21SkillName09A=The Twinning (pt. 1)
tagClass21SkillDescription09A=There are those among the Primordials who claim that the Necrotic could not have spawned naturally on its own, that a being of such power must have had a twin of equal potency but opposite purpose.
tagClass21SkillName09B=The Twinning (pt. 2)
tagClass21SkillDescription09B=There are those among the Primordials who claim the Necrotic's equal and opposite is me, myself.

tagClass21SkillName10A=Unadulterated Power
tagClass21SkillDescription10A=^b[Secondary Modifier] [Nova] [AOE] ^n^o[When Hit]^n^n^wRaw, unadulterated power, and the expulsion and abuse thereof. That's the Necrotic's motif. Enemies who would strike the Necrotic will be subjected to this raw power.

tagClass21SkillName11A=Unholy Hailfire
tagClass21SkillDescription11A=^b[Spell] [Fragmenting] [AOE] [Timed]^n^o[Interval: 0.8 Seconds]^n^n^w^r"To paint the day's sky black, and the night's sky red. That is my goal, Incarnate."

tagClass21SkillName12A=Obsidian Prison
tagClass21SkillDescription12A=^b[Spell] [AOE] [Debuff]^n^n^r"Death is inescapable, Incarnate, even for us Primordials. I just happen to be the Reaper."

tagClass21SkillName13A=To End Evil
tagClass21SkillDescription13A=^b[Spell] [Nova] [AOE] [Debuff]^n^n^wTo wish to be the first to strike down the Necrotic is a death wish. My advice: strive to be the second.

tagClass21SkillName14A=Arcane Experience
tagClass21SkillDescription14A=^b[Passive]^n^n^wThe Necrotic's experience with reality itself provides it with an enhanced ability to do as it pleases in the universe.

tagClass21SkillName15A=Soul Seeker
tagClass21SkillDescription15A=^b[Secondary Modifier] [Timed] [Buff]^n^n^wThe Necrotic was more than willing to do whatever it took to reap life from a plane, even corporealizing riftborn energies into physical forms.

tagClass21SkillName16A=Foreknowledge
tagClass21SkillDescription16A=^b[Buff]^n^n^wIf one were to exist for the purpose of collecting life, it would undoubtedly help if one possessed an awareness of what it would eventually contend with in doing so.

tagClass21SkillName17A=Situational Awareness
tagClass21SkillDescription17A=^b[Modifier]^n^n^wThe Necrotic's ability to quickly assess its surroundings has made it incredibly difficult to pin down on the battlefield.

tagClass21SkillName19A=Planeswalker
tagClass21SkillDescription19A=^b[Buff] [Timed] [HP Threshold] [Delayed Cooldown]^n^n^wThe Necrotic is capable of melding between planes, although only for a short time and avoid even death while between realms.

tagClass21SkillName20A=From Beyond
tagClass21SkillDescription20A=^b[Passive]^n^n^wThe Necrotic's chaotic powers come from beyond this realm, and beyond the next.

tagClass21SkillName21A=Conjure Dreadguard
tagClass21SkillDescription21A=^b[Spell] [Beam] [Player Scaled Pet]^n^n^wWhat better way to fight against the meddling Chthonian hordes than to steal some of their best warriors? The Necrotic thought it'd be a good idea too.{^n}^oScales with player damage bonuses. More Dreadguards can be summoned with further investment. 

#Unused
tagClass21SkillName18A=Doombringer
tagClass21SkillDescription18A=^b[Spell] [Projectile Drop] [Timed] [AOE]^n^n^wIf the Necrotic were to be waging an excessively long battle, it was likely it would bring down the sky itself, raining doom onto those foolish enough to meet the Necrotic in battle.

oldtagClass21SkillDescription18A=If the Necrotic were to be waging an excessively long battle, it was likely it would conjure its infamous banner, Soth-Voonith, which would provide the Necrotic with a small army in only a few short moments.{^n}^oNote that units summoned by Soth-Voonith will protect Soth-Voonith's position, not yours, and do not scale with Player or Pet bonuses.{^n}{^n}Summons 3 prawns every 5 seconds. The prawns reduce enemy damage and spawn an acid pool on death.
tagClass21Skill18SummonName=Soth-Voonith
tagClass21SkillName18B=Summon Prawn
tagClass21SkillDescription18B=No creature is safe from the Necrotic's collection, not even lesser beings of the planes. Once harvested and empowered by the Necrotic, however, even Prawns will prove dangerous.
tagClass21Skill18SummonName2=Necro-Prawn
tagClass21SkillName18C=Summon Ghoul
tagClass21SkillDescription18C=Being barely on the edge of life counts as lively enough, as far as the Necrotic is concerned. Soth-Voonith is more than happy to offer some cursed and twisted humans to defend its master.
tagClass21Skill18SummonName3=Necro-Ghoul
tagClass21SkillName18D=Summon Dranghoul
tagClass21SkillDescription18D=They say a Dranghoul could carve a boulder in two or tank a cannonball, but such feats are irrelevant to the Necrotic's might. It was better to bow and serve than be eradicated.
tagClass21Skill18SummonName4=Necro-Dranghoul
tagClass21SkillName18E=Summon Dreadguard
tagClass21SkillDescription18E=What better way to fight against the meddling Chthonian hordes than to steal some of their best warriors? The Necrotic thought it'd be a good idea too.
tagClass21Skill18SummonName5=Dominated Dreadguard
tagClass21Skill18SummonName5Attack3=Dreadguard Attack
tagClass21SkillName18F=Summon Golem
tagClass21SkillDescription18F=How many men and women have been claimed by the Necrotic's incessant soul harvest? Enough to mold into terrifying golems of supreme might, rivaled only perhaps by the Necrotic itself.
tagClass21Skill18SummonName6=Necro-Golem





tagClass21SkillName2116=Reaper's Fragment - Void Knight
tagClass21SkillDescription2116=^ZThe Necrotic + Terror Knight{^n}^o[Modifier to Engage]^n^wFor all the eldritch horrors it has unleashed, it should come as no surprise that the Necrotic has done a good job of supporting Lord Terror's cause. There are rumors, in fact, that the Necrotic is Lord Terror himself. The Void Knight of Terror comes for all, and all come for him. ^n^rRequires 32 points in Terror Knight and at least one point in Necrotic.
tagClass21SkillName2116X=Glare of the Void Knight
tagClass21SkillDescription2116X=Gaining 140 Offensive Ability and Converting 100% Vitality Damage to Chaos Damage.
tagClass21SkillName2117=Reaper's Fragment - Sinner
tagClass21SkillDescription2117=^ZThe Necrotic + Evocator{^n}^o[Modifier to Might of Magic]^n^wThe Necrotic was no stranger to the lesser magics of the world, and could certainly make use of them if it willed. At the very least, it could easily find a way to defend itself against them, too. ^n^rRequires 32 points in Evocator and at least one point in Necrotic.
tagClass21SkillName2118=Reaper's Fragment - Vagabond
tagClass21SkillDescription2118=^ZThe Necrotic + Outrider{^n}^o[Modifier to Biobomb]^n^wWhen the Necrotic searched through the stores of a legion outpost, it was more than enticed by a particularly nefarious biochemical weapon - a familiar tool of contracted soldiers and Outriders alike. ^n^rRequires 32 points in Outrider and at least one point in Necrotic.
tagClass21SkillName2119=Reaper's Fragment - Judicator
tagClass21SkillDescription2119=^ZThe Necrotic + Champion{^n}^o[Modifier to With Reckless Abandon]^n^wOn whose authority does the Necrotic pass judgment on its foes? Its own, of course. ^n^rRequires 32 points in Champion and at least one point in Necrotic.
tagClass21SkillName2119X=Soul Rip
tagClass21SkillName2120=Reaper's Fragment - Pursuer

tagZenith_Relic001_003DESC=^ZTerror Knight + Outrider{^n}^wLimitless in their scope for finding and terminating their prey, Outriders were very much like Terror Knights. Those that pledged themselves to Lord Terror were able to decimate foes far and wide with extreme efficiency.
tagZenith_Relic001_004=Combat Art: Dreadnaughts
tagZenith_Relic001_004DESC=^ZTerror Knight + Champion{^n}^wChampions were deadly even under ordinary circumstances. Those that fell into Lord Terror's ranks were made ever more dangerous.
tagZenith_Relic001_005=Combat Art: Desolators
tagZenith_Relic001_005DESC=^ZTerror Knight + Riftstalker{^n}^wIntriguing that there exists a Riftstalker within Lord Terror's forces. Surely such a being would be a formidable foe on the battlefield, spouting hard-hitting attacks and improved defenses alike, all empowered by the void and Lord Terror himself. 
tagZenith_Relic001_006=Combat Art: Void Knights
tagZenith_Relic001_006DESC=^ZTerror Knight + the Necrotic{^n}^wThe best enemy is the one that dies quickest. The Necrotic was an expert at reducing even the sturdiest of enemies to frail shadows of their former selves. Lord Terror would have been proud.

tagZenith_Relic002_001DESC=^ZEvocator + Terror Knight{^n}^wEvocators generally did not care to get their hands dirty directly, but their time entertaining the royal courts quickly taught them that combative experience was an importance part of opulence. 
tagZenith_Relic002_003=Gunmage Sorcery
tagZenith_Relic002_003DESC=^ZEvocator + Outrider^wStratagem and Sorcery combined, turn the arcane into weapons and tactics into magic.

tagZenith_Relic002_005DESC=^ZEvocator + Riftstalker{^n}^wBringing the powers of the planes down to more basic elements is a nontrivial task, but doable. Sure is a volatile process, though. 
tagZenith_Relic002_006=Sinner Sorcery
tagZenith_Relic002_006DESC=^ZEvocator + the Necrotic{^n}^wThe raw power one might acquire, beholden to the Necrotic, could taint the very nature of arcane sorceries, drawing them to vile effect.

tagZenith_Relic003_001=Stratagem of the Hell Hunter
tagZenith_Relic003_001DESC=^ZOutrider + Terror Knight{^n}^wTerror Knights were not atypical soldiers insofar as their combative tactics went. They knew that if an enemy were to hit you, you needed to hit back harder.
tagZenith_Relic003_002=Stratagem of the Gunmage
tagZenith_Relic003_002DESC=^ZOutrider + Evocator{^n}^wEvocators were always fantastic at taking what they had and making something more from it. Such a talent could manifest as either deception or mysticism, or even both.
tagZenith_Relic003_004=Stratagem of the Stalker
tagZenith_Relic003_004DESC=^ZOutrider + Champion{^n}^wTo be pursued by a Champion of Vallithel would have been a death sentence, as there would be little to prevent their arrival. Once you've been found, a swift justice would surely be executed.
tagZenith_Relic003_005=Stratagem of the Disruptor
tagZenith_Relic003_005DESC=^ZOutrider + Riftstalker{^n}^wMaintaing a battlefield advantage involved physically controlling the battlefield; Riftstalkers were innately good at that, but the expertise and tactics of Outriders surely helped out in that regard.
tagZenith_Relic003_006=Stratagem of the Vagabond
tagZenith_Relic003_006DESC=^ZOutrider + the Necrotic{^n}^wOverly saturated with the life force of others, the very fiber of the Necrotic is sour. Going near to it is not likely a wise idea.
