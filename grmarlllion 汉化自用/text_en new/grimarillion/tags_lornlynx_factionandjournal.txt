tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA01Text=It has become quite obvious that I have angered some very determined enemies. No less than three assassination attempts in as many weeks. Outrageous! My position is not that important to the empire to warrant such aggression. Nor am I that despised by any of the factions within the city, not to my knowledge.{^n}{^n}No, this doesn't feel politically driven. It's as if it were a personal vendetta. With the identities of the assassins pointing in several disparate directions, it is difficult to paint the full picture. I need more information. My advisors now insist that I have four guards with me at all times. What a bother.{^n}{^n}Advisor Aldritch has suggested that, until we know more about the nature of my attackers, I should avoid all public hearings, to minimize risk. I believe he is using this as an opportunity to solidify his position, but he is not wrong either. For now I will play to his tune and stay out of public affairs. Aldritch and the rest of the council will attend to the public while I delve to the bottom of this plot against me.{^n}{^n}-Khallos Strune, Mayor of Port Valbury{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/2)
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA02Text=I no longer know what game Aldritch is playing, but it has come at a cost to our citizens and that I cannot allow to continue. Whether out of malice or plain incompetence, I have not been receiving updates regarding recent events in Port Valbury, the tragically mishandled trash issues in old town in particular. I am now hearing rumors of outright revolt and dissent among the citizens.{^n}{^n}Whatever the council had done in my absence was clearly not done in the best interest of the citizenry. Tomorrow I intend to return to the public eye and remove Van Aldritch from the position of High Advisor, risk against my life be damned.{^n}{^n}But there is some good news in all this. Keval, the nightblade once under my employ, has asked to meet. He promises me information regarding a plot against my life.{^n}{^n}- Khallos Strune, Mayor of Port Valbury{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/2)
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA10Text=Life has been good for us here in Port Valbury. Alden and I have been happily married for 3 years now. Our business is thriving and Alden was hopeful to get a second shop opened up in high town by this time next year. But he came home from the court disappointed. Apparently the mayor has been denying all requests for an audience and his newly appointed High Advisor dismissed Alden's appeal for a deed without even hearing his case.{^n}{^n}Now there's the mess with the garbage spilling out of the old dumping ground. Everyone I've asked doesn't seem to know anything about why trash has been redirected to the already full dump in our district. The new curfew also hasn't been kind to business as we've had to close down early each night.{^n}{^n}Omeer and Shara are both terrified. They think something is wrong and we should all leave the city. Alden says there's nothing to be concerned about.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/5)
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA11Text=Several of our neighbors have moved away. They've had enough of the growing garbage problem and the sudden surge in crime here in old town. Omeer and Shara are the latest to leave. Shara was crying when she begged us to come with them. But our business is here and we can't just pack up.{^n}{^n}Food around the city is starting to be rationed. Shops are closing. Alden and I are keeping our shop open, but he has started hiding cheese and other food down in the basement; just in case, he says. I wonder if maybe Shara was right. Maybe we should be leaving too.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/5)
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA12Text=Men broke into the shop. They cleaned out the store and shattered Alden's leg when he resisted. The bone was sticking right through the skin of his thigh and I don't know what to do. The only doctor is in high town, but the bridge has been blocked off by the guard. I wrapped it as best I could but it still bleeds occasionally.{^n}{^n}We've been hiding in the basement since that night. Alden wakes up from time to time, but he seems confused and feverish. We should have left weeks ago when the others did. Occasionally I hear someone entering upstairs and rummaging through the shelves. I hope that they don't discover the stairwell leading down here. I'm so scared.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/5)
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA13Text=Alden hasn't woken up in a day. I tried to make him eat or drink something, but he can't keep anything down. He is so pale. He is going to die soon. I think I have known this fact for days, but I just didn't want to believe it.{^n}{^n}The looters have stopped coming by, likely because there is nothing left to steal. I've braved the upstairs to see what has happened since the fighting stopped and the sight was terrifying to behold. Parts of the city are burning. Most of the homes are abandoned or destroyed. One day, I witnessed a couple running between buildings with their child and a small sack of belongings. I should leave too, but I can't leave Alden.{^n}{^n}I don't understand how the city could turn to this so quickly. One moment, we were planning the next stages of our business, the next the city is in a state of war. The worst of it seems to be over though. It's been quiet, so quiet...{^n}{^n}                                                                       (4/5)
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA14Text=Last night I heard somebody scream. When I went upstairs to check, I saw some people wandering the streets. But it was a strange, aimless sort of walk. Nobody spoke. Then I heard the scream again and I turned my head to a most grisly sight. A putrid thing of foul flesh dragged a man out of some rubble and disemboweled him. I stifled a scream of my own and quickly ran back downstairs.{^n}{^n}All the commotion had caused my husband to stir and he stood up for the first time in days. But his eyes were glazed over and dull and his movements like the people outside. His skin was chalk white and his chest did not move with the rhythmic breathing of the living. Hands shaking, I grabbed the revolver he gave me and pointed it at his head. He did not talk; he did not even try to move out of the way. He just kept approaching me in a slow unsteady gait. At that moment I understood what wandered the streets outside and I clenched my tear-swollen eyes as I pulled the trigger.{^n}{^n}I can't sleep anymore. My husband's body lies next to me, a hole in his skull. There is nothing left for me here. It's time to go before no hope of escape remains, before my strength has left me. I have to run until my legs can carry me no further; away from Valbury, away from my shattered life.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (5/5)
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA01Text=We've been on the run for what feels like weeks now. The Aetherials are always on our heels, spreading like wildfire across the countryside. The children are starving; the few bites of food we manage to scavenge on the go aren't enough for all four of us. I'm not sure how much more of this we can take.{^n}{^n}Word on the road is that the Cult of Ch'thon is accepting members, that they have food and shelter for all. I've always pictured them as heretical lunatics, howling at the moon as they bathe in blood, but the promises of safety may be too much to pass on. Thallon cringes at the thought of being seen among the Bloodsworn, but we agree that it may be a necessary evil in order to survive. Our children deserve to eat.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/3)
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA02Text=Life among the Bloodsworn has required some changes to our little family, mainly that we can only see the children after the day's rituals and chores are finished, which usually last late into the evening. Some days I don't see them at all until they are already asleep. My husband is having a difficult time with the prayers, he calls them blasphemous filth, but I remind him that we are doing this for our family's survival.{^n}{^n}Myself, I cannot help but question the gods who have given us nothing except poverty. But here, under the protection of Ch'thon, we are safe and fed. The Bloodsworn have given us everything they had promised, and more. All they ask in return is our devotion and a little bit of blood.{^n}{^n}So I can't help myself when I chant a little louder each morning as I sing my praises to Ch'thon. The cuts from the ritual knife serve as a gentle reminder that we are still alive and not rotting out in the wilderness. It feels...good. By Ch'thon, it feels good...{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/3)
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA03Text=All begins and ends with Ch'thon. I can see that now. My family's suffering, the poverty we've endured? These are all symptoms of our separation from Ch'thon. The Bloodsworn have shown me the way to salvation.{^n}{^n}I have prayed long and hard at the altar, poured my lifeblood out onto the stones until the answers came to me. The only way my family can truly be safe is to be reunited with Ch'thon.{^n}{^n}I have made the necessary arrangements. The sacrifice will proceed at dawn.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/3)
tagLoreObj_AreaCDarvale_NoteA04Text=Everything is proceeding as the Bloodlord had intended. My year-long employment as the town's Apothecary has earned me the people's trust and I am now in the perfect position to spread our cause. And for those who refuse to listen to reason, who refuse to embrace the truth that is Ch'thon, my position as healer has made it an easy thing to take life without arousing suspicion. A little bit of powder from the Asterkarn Nightshade root mixed in with a prescription will put anyone to sleep for hours.{^n}{^n}After that, it is a simple matter of retrieving the dissenter and perform the required observances. With each person we return to Ch'thon, I carve His sigil in their flesh. For me it is the most important step in the early stage of the draining ritual. The blood drains quickly from a slit across the carotid artery and drains into the specially prepared oak casks that the carpenter, another blessed by the Bloodlord with this task, prepares for me. Not as nice as the glass vessels we have been preparing, but much easier to hide suspicion. The body is stored in a second barrel, weighed down with stones, and then sunk to the bottom of the lake. Nearly every death over the last year has added to our tribute with no suspicion falling upon us.{^n}{^n}But now, with the servants of the false gods arriving at the capital and spreading havoc across the empire, our time has finally arrived to reveal ourselves from the shadows and usher humanity into the end times. All shall receive the gift of reunification!{^n}{^n}-Zaria, Apothecary of Darkvale{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/2)
tagLoreObj_AreaCDarvale_NoteA05Text=I have been informed by messengers of the Bloodlord that the preparations for the resurrection at the Necropolis have begun. Our time to seize the town is now. The sheriff and his peacekeepers will be dealt with first. With them gone, the remaining civilians will fall in line with our doctrines or be harvested for the ritual. I have already dispatched my loyal Bloodsworn to barricade the Darkvale Gates, trapping the refugees inside. They will all fuel the ritual in due time.{^n}{^n}Once news of this reaches the Black Legion, we will have to be prepared for a counter assault. I will personally see to converting the frightened and misguided who remain in Darkvale. If they will not join our cause, then they can dance at the end of a rope and be drained as encouragement to those who have yet to choose.{^n}{^n}They must all learn that there is no place safer than under the guidance of the Bloodlord. They must come to understand that there is no peace to be found in the lands to the south. Only in the warm embrace of Ch'thon will we truly be where we belong.{^n}{^n}-Zaria the Carver{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/2)
tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note03Text=Something powerful is coming from beyond. I have sensed its approach for some time now. But like a dream or some distant memory, the details were lost to me... until now.{^n}{^n}I can feel it clawing its way through the veil somewhere to the northeast of Burrwitch, no doubt drawn here by the maelstrom of otherworldly corruption. I dare say, its nature eludes even me; but it is neither flesh nor spirit. I must discover what it is we are facing and, should the need arise, seal it away again behind the barrier between worlds.{^n}{^n}The Order need not concern itself with these matters quite yet. I must do this alone...{^n}{^n}Uroboruuk{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/2)
tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note04Text=I will rip the bones from a thousand for this treachery. At a great cost I have survived a deadly attack.{^n}{^n}I had discovered a large contingent of Chthonic fiends. At first, I thought they were the source of power that I sought and so I trailed them. As they travelled North, I soon realized that they too were after the same thing as I. They made their way to the cliffs by way of the swamp. In following them, I had walked right into an ambush as I was suddenly attacked from behind.{^n}{^n}The fight was devastating and I destroyed dozens in the ensuing conflict. However, in the midst of battle, several of the Harbingers cornered my Guardian. I first believed they intended to destroy it; but when they exploded, a rush of Chthonic energy surged into my creation and severed our link. The animated mass of bone turned on me, and I knew then that the Harbingers had found a way to corrupt my necromantic creation. I do not yet understand how they were capable of such an act, but it was unlike anything I have ever seen Chthonic beings do.{^n}{^n}If the fiends of the Void are able to harness this power on a larger scale, then even the Order of Death's Vigil will find itself outmatched. I must maintain hope that what I seek will be an answer to fighting this darkness. With each step the power grows and others will be drawn to it. I must hurry.{^n}{^n}Uroboruuk{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/2)
tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note03Text=The Messenger is harsh to deal with. With each exchange I feel drained as though my life were being drawn into a deep well. Everything appears darker and farther away as if seen through a long tunnel. A lesser man without the years of Inquisitor mental training would be consumed.{^n}{^n}Even as I write this, I can sense its energy rippling through the room. I can feel it like worms twitching below my skin. It burrows and pulls, urging me to get closer. I dread to think of what would become of any of my Chosen should they get too close to this entity. What would remain, I cannot say, but I suspect the Messenger would shuck the mind and claim the body for its own.{^n}{^n}I fear there are none who would understand or survive this secret. I alone must shoulder this burden and so I will steel myself and endure. I have taken on a great risk, but the fate of the world hinges on the success of The Chosen and the pact that I have made.{^n}{^n}Father Kymon{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/2)
tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note04Text=There are questions that have been scratching at the back of my mind. I have tried to push them aside but with each conversation I have with the Messenger they become harder to ignore.{^n}{^n}I must ask: when the last demon is driven from this world, what will become of us then? In my heart, I fear I already know the answer, but dare not speak it out loud. I have no doubt that I have made the right choice. The power I have revived will be humanity's salvation from the blood fiends of the Chthonic Void.{^n}{^n}However, there must always be evil. And when there is no evil left to conquer who or, more frighteningly, what will fill that emptiness? Will we become as reviled as those who we oppose? The Primordial powers have no care or sympathy for humanity. Without shackles, this power I have borrowed could be just as disastrous as, or perhaps even worse than, Ch'thon.{^n}{^n}I now wish I had not burned the town where I awoke this ancient being. If it ever needs to be stopped I may have destroyed the last remaining knowledge to unmake it.{^n}{^n}Father Kymon{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/2)
tagLoreObj_AreaDAlpine_NoteA01Text=*The notebook is caked in dried blood and mud and many pages appear to have been deliberately torn out.*{^n}{^n}Day 3: John holds our Silvie with one arm as he drives the wagon. He is smiling and happy as he tells us that we should reach the mountain in a few days. It's sad to leave our home but I am hopeful for a better life far away from the dangers that seem to be ever increasing here in the north.{^n}{^n}Day 4: Silvie is so happy, running along the side of the wagon picking flowers. I was really worried about her being unhappy as we left behind the only home she has ever known. The wonder and splendor that is youth. It warms my heart.{^n}{^n}Day 6: The mountains are looming ahead of us and the cold is getting sharp. I can see the worry in John's face as he tries to keep up his spirits. I know he only wants to protect us from the dangers and I can only pray that we make it past the mountain before the snow.{^n}{^n}Day 8: We are in the shadow of the mountain now and the days are shorter. Snow has started to fall and the cold came on so suddenly it surprised us. We have warm clothes but the wind cuts right through them.{^n}{^n}Day 11: We have reached a flat at the base of a fort. There are a few other travelers here who have told us the way through to Darkvale is blocked. With our food running low, we were hoping to resupply at the Darkvale Gate Merchant District. Now I don't know what we will do. Turning back is not an option with the snow coming down so fast. John says he is going to talk to the others soon.{^n}{^n}Day 16: The horse died today. John is saddened by this but at least it will feed us until help arrives. I hate that we had to make this trip with Silvie. She is only nine and I don't like the way the other men at the camp look at her.{^n}{^n}Day 22: All of our horse meat is gone. It would have lasted longer if we didn't have to share it with the others. But John said things could have gone badly if we did not. I don't like thinking about what he meant by that.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/3)
tagLoreObj_AreaDAlpine_NoteA02Text=Day 28: Gods protect us. We have been starving. I spent the morning searching the woods for nuts and bugs to eat. I can't believe that it doesn't shame me to say I have been eating bugs when I can find them. When I got back to the camp I found that John had killed a man that attacked our daughter.{^n}{^n}Day 29: John has brought Silvie and me a small portion of meat. I don't ask where he got it.{^n}{^n}Day 30: The other men asked what happened to their friend. John told them that he tried to hurt our little girl and offered them some freshly cut meat. They took it without another word and left us alone. Does friendship mean so little in these times?{^n}{^n}Day 36: John offered Silvie to one of the men in the camp. When the man came into the tent to make his advance, John killed him in front of Silvie and me. I am so hungry I don't even care.{^n}{^n}Day ??: It's so hard to write. Numb fingers and the cold dulls my thoughts. The dark of the mountain makes it easy to lose track of the days.{^n}{^n}Day ??: Another man has been lured to our tent. An exchange of food for the promise of warmth. They must know that it's a trap. Maybe they are ready to die. They lie to themselves even as they walk into the butcher's blade.{^n}{^n}Day ??: Our next visitor was wise to the attack. John killed him but not without suffering a terrible wound. He is not sure he will survive the night. I find that I don't care as much as I should. All I see is a potential meal.  Gods, what is happening to me?{^n}{^n}Day?? John lasted longer than we've expected, draining our dwindling food supplies. I took care of it. Now have food for a long while.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/3)
tagLoreObj_AreaDAlpine_NoteA03Text=Day ??: Silvie has become angry. Spiteful. Malevolent. Where did all the tenderness and innocence of my little girl go? Why is it that I don't care anymore? Should care. But feel nothing.{^n}{^n}Day ??: There is no one left here in camp. All gone. We must move. Hard to hide blood, frozen snow. Easy for prey to know.{^n}{^n}Day ??: Harder to write. Hard to think about anything but the hunger.{^n}{^n}Day ??: New place off road. Easy to lure new travelers going south. Looking for safe place. Never find it.{^n}{^n}Day ??: No food again. I encourage Silvie to find people to bring here for food. She is gleeful at suggestion. John gone, so I do the killing now.{^n}{^n}Day ??: So hungry. Don't even bother to cook food anymore.{^n}{^n}Day ??: Talk to woman today. Still alive as we eat. Blood in mouth. She ask why? Only word I say: "hungry". Silvie laugh that she talk while we eat her.{^n}{^n}Day ??: Hair falling out. Don't care.{^n}{^n}Day ??: The men won't be lured no more. They know what awaits them. No matter. We chase.{^n}{^n}Day ??: Silvie good hunter now. She likes kill. Me too. Should feel bad. Know it's wrong. But it feels so good to feed.{^n}{^n}Day ??: Don't feel cold no more. Shards of frozen blood cut lips. Split gums. Don't care.{^n}{^n}Day ?? Chase men. Terror makes flesh taste sweeter. Good.{^n}{^n}Day ??: So hungry. Must find more.{^n}{^n}*The rest of the text is impossible to make out.*{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/3)
tagLoreObj_AreaDDravis_NoteA04Text=Daila,{^n}I shake in anticipation of what is to come, I can hardly write these words with a stable hand. Our father, our legacy, it is more than I could have ever asked for, more than I could have even imagined. To deny us this heritage...it is a crime against his very children. But I have learned his secrets and I will not be denied.{^n}{^n}Our father is immortal, Daila. It has taken him a thousand-thousand souls trapped within a single moment of agony to accomplish this impossible deed. What dark day in history served in the pursuit of immortality, I cannot say. But here, in the Necropolis, our father prepared a different ritual. This one was meant to harvest what remained of the tormented dead within the grave site, to replenish his own shattered being, but for whatever reason he never finished it. The sigil was abandoned. All that remained was to light the pyre and offer a living sacrifice.{^n}{^n}Without hesitation, I finished what he could not. Though I am not truly immortal as he is, the power within these souls will be enough for me to track him down and repay him for all the suffering he has instilled upon us. Then, when my vengeance is complete, I shall use the calamity that now consumes the world to do as our father had before, all those centuries ago.{^n}{^n}Should you reconsider in joining me, Daila, seek me out to the East. I shall be standing triumphantly over our father's ashes.{^n}{^n}Dravis{^n}{^n}                                                                       (4/4)
tagLoreObj_AreaDNecropolis_NoteA01Text=I have been commissioned to construct a grand mausoleum that will house the thousands of dead from the great battle with the west. This will be my Magnum Opus. The project will take many decades and at my age it is unlikely that I will live to see its completion.{^n}{^n}I have begun drafting the plans in my head. The main tomb will be centered around a vast well, which will house most of the fallen. The quantity of earth we will need to move is staggering, but it will serve as a foundation for the rest of the city of the dead. While this is being done, a small army of civil servants will be carefully collecting the bodies, crafting notices of identification, and preparing them for temporary burial. It will be many years before the fallen receive their proper burial.{^n}{^n}We have started construction of temporary mass grave structures to hold them. Some of the families have insisted that they take the remains to which I have no objection but I cannot imagine why they would not want their loved ones to be honored here, at the site of their glorious victory. I should note that the bodies of the enemy will be shipped back to their border and left for them to do with as they please. I mean no disrespect to their fallen but, quite frankly, they are not our problem.{^n}{^n}There are thousands of workers being commissioned for the digging, hauling and carving of the stone. Where Erulan found so many able-bodied and willing workers so quickly is obvious. Slaves. Brought from the imperial prison mines, or enemy soldiers from the war.  Distasteful, but there is too much work to get done to be timid about this.{^n}{^n}So many things to consider and prepare. I am eager to get started. I can only hope that my wife and son will be happy here. It won't be much more than a mining town for a few years, but the work is too important to leave to any other.{^n}{^n}The Grand Architect, Hemal Listari{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/3)
tagLoreObj_AreaDNecropolis_NoteA02Text=After ten years, the Necropolis, as it has come to be known, is more than halfway finished. Far ahead of my early projections. Though I can't say it has been without complications.{^n}{^n}I was shocked when an agent of the Erulan Imperium appeared and began reassigning workers and equipment without my approval. Apparently the Imperium is having an additional chamber constructed beneath my original designs. These imbeciles have no sense of grandeur and design. This is my life's work we are talking about! I don't care how much the Imperium is paying me. I will not stand for it.{^n}{^n}Over the last seven months, I have written several distasteful letters to the Erulan council stating my displeasure with these arrangements. Not a single response. Every time I see that wretched man, Vestiaris, I confront him on the subject; and every time he gives me the same tired response: "I have been appointed by the Erulan Imperium. If you take issue with my duties here, please take it up with them". Well they can ignore me all they want. This is my vision and I will not be pushed aside as it is befouled. I don't care how long it takes. I will find out what they are doing down there and I will put an end to it.{^n}{^n}The Grand Architect, Hemal Listari{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/3)
tagLoreObj_AreaDNecropolis_NoteA03Text=My father, Hemal Listari, is dead. After nearly twenty years of his finest work, the Necropolis is complete. It is of great misfortune that he did not live to see his final work completed, having suddenly passed away mere days ago. It haunts me how strong and healthy he was to die as suddenly as he did. I am deeply saddened, and yet filled with pride and happiness that I was handed the honor of finishing his grand designs. The Imperium has agreed to have him entombed here, a great honor to our family name to be at rest with so many valiant defenders of our great nation.{^n}{^n}As for myself, I am designing my father's mausoleum and then I must leave for my next commission. I have been tasked with the construction of a massive tunnel that will serve as passage between the conquered northlands and the Arkovian south; perhaps not as noble a project as the great Necropolis, but it will be mine and I have many years to fill my father's shoes.{^n}{^n}I wanted to stay and oversee the construction of my father's mausoleum, but the orders were clear that I get started on the passage immediately. I don't understand the rush or insistence. I almost feel like they are forcing me to leave.{^n}{^n}Assistant Architect, Modin Listari{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/3)

Just as evil must be purged of the soul, so the heretic must be purged of the living.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/4)

tagLoreObj_BookC01Text=To understand the flows of the Aether, one must first learn to appreciate its inherent risks. The arcane art is not a plaything, nor is it a tool meant to be abused. Countless young arcanists have lost their lives to carelessness and malpractice. Proper control of the Aether requires years of practice under the careful supervision of the Gildam Arcanum, the only formal office sanctioned to instruct and research the art of the arcane. Do not confuse what is lectured here with the teachings of the hypothetical witch gods, a common misconception amongst the uneducated. There are no gods. There is only reality and the science of the arcane.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/2)
tagLoreObj_BookC02Text=To reinforce the ingenuity of arcanists both living and dead, we turn to the works of Master Maiven, a prolific arcanist from the third age of our glorious empire. Master Maiven was able to bend the inherently destructive flows of the Aether to her will in order to manifest a protective barrier around herself. This technique is a stellar example of how the Gildam Arcanum continually strives to break our preconceptions of the Aether, creating entirely new schools of thought within the arcane arts.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/2)
tagLoreObj_BookD01Text=In all the history of our great nation, there has been no greater atrocity committed than the creation of the vile vermin we call Slith. Part man, part serpent, the Slith were a testament to the dangers of the arcane and served as the driving force behind the formation of the Gildam Arcanum and its tighter sanctions on arcane practices.{^n}{^n}The Slith owe their existence to the actions of a single individual: Oswald Hargate. Backed by family wealth and a passion for research, Oswald aspired to leave his mark upon the study of the arcane. Little did he know that his legacy would leave a permanent stain upon all Arcanists and their field.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/3)
tagLoreObj_BookD02Text=Oswald Hargate firmly believed that the Aether could be used to create new life. Convinced that he could supersede the gods, Oswald set out to perform his heinous research in a, to this day, unknown location.{^n}{^n}Though not much is known about the exact details of his research, the results were quite clear. Calling his creation a Slith, for its slithering movement and snake-like lower body, Oswald triumphantly announced his findings to the Arcanum Society. The abomination bore the torso of a man and the tail of a snake, though its reptilian snout was unlike either species. Its eyes stared back at you with a hint of human sorrow, though it was clearly a dulled mind with no indication of a human conscience trapped within the slith body.{^n}{^n}Those attending were shocked by the blatant disregard for the gods and their domain. Following a brief trial, Oswald was charged with endangering society and was imprisoned for the remainder of his life. The specimen was destroyed and its ashes scattered to the winds. With Oswald behind bars and the slith dead, all believed that the nightmare was over; but they were wrong.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/3)
tagLoreObj_BookD03Text=When the first slith began to appear in the area known as Wightmire, it became clear that Oswald did not create just one slith. As his laboratory was never uncovered, officials could only guess as to the origin of the new species. The slith were incredibly invasive, easily dominating the local food chain and reproducing at an alarming rate.{^n}{^n}As their numbers multiplied, the slith adapted a primitive tribal hierarchy, with certain members of their packs exhibiting clear authority over the rest. And, perhaps most alarmingly of all, shamanistic behavior was reported among the slith population, indicating a strong connection to the Aether and perhaps their unnatural origins.{^n}{^n}All efforts to exterminate the slith proved fruitless, with the species simply returning at a new location from hidden nests and caverns. It is without a doubt that the actions of one arrogant individual will continue to reverberate across countless generations to come.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/3)
tagLoreObj_BookD04Text=First day at my new lab. I must say, I am thrilled to get started. The days of having my nose stuck in the books are over. There comes a time when studying old tomes reaches its limit. Eventually, one must set out on their own to pursue new ventures and ideas not yet considered. It is our sacred duty as scholars to leave a mark upon the world!{^n}{^n}My wife, Helen, and my dearest daughter Ellena will be joining me soon at our new home. Helen has expressed concern about our little girl growing up in a laboratory, so far away from other children, but I've calmed her down. Ellena will have everything she requires, and Burrwitch is just a short boat ride away should she ask for a playmate.{^n}{^n}Together, Helen and I are going to do something no Arcanist has dared even consider: the creation of new life. The Aether is a wondrous source of energy, and yet nobody's stopped to ponder its effects upon organic material. Helen's expertise in the biological arts should prove most valuable in this endeavor.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/4)
tagLoreObj_BookD05Text=At Helen's recommendation, I have chosen the lowly green swamp adder as the basis of my experiment. Its short lifespan and rapidly shedding skin made for a malleable test subject. The initial results seemed promising at first. Using high concentrations of Aether energy, we were able to instill various mutations within the specimens, creating new limbs or inducing gigantism. Unfortunately, none of the samples survived beyond a couple weeks, their higher brain functions being seemingly incapable of handling the introduction of additional bodily elements.{^n}{^n}For our second batch of experiments, we molded the adders with a few grobles captured by local trappers. The results were...curious to say the least. While this was not the breakthrough I was looking for, we seem to be heading in the right direction. The dull mind of a groble was capable of adapting to its new body, but its primitive and disgustingly malformed physique would see me become the laughing stock of my colleagues. No, I must see this through to its logical conclusion. Helen may frown upon it, but the next step seems clear as day to me...{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/4)
tagLoreObj_BookD06Text=I have sent Helen and Ellena away for the summer to visit family in the capital while I continue my work alone. I tasked a few unsavory individuals to gather "volunteers" for the next stage of my research, mere vagrants and Rovers, people nobody would miss. The fees they charged were considerable, but I will pay any price when I am so close to my breakthrough.{^n}{^n}The samples arrived in the middle of the night, delivered to their cells as promised. My collaborators took their pay and left promptly without asking any questions. Frankly, they looked a bit disturbed. But I was unfazed. They are but simpletons, unable to fathom the importance of my work.{^n}{^n}The specimens began stirring by morning, their frightened cries echoing throughout the lab. I explained to them that they were selected for an important duty, that their lives would finally have meaning and purpose. The scum should have been thanking me, but instead they cursed me as a madman and criminal. I dismissed their accusations and got to work. There was much to be done.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/4)
tagLoreObj_BookD07Text=Helen and Ellena returned early from their trip. While Ellena was otherwise occupied with her toys in the living quarters, Helen came down into the lab to find me in the midst of my latest study. The horrified look on her face is something I shall never forget. I tried to be reasonable. I explained that what she witnessed was merely a stepping stone, that those men and women died so that our work would not be squandered on snakes and grobles. But she would not budge.{^n}{^n}My wife, my partner, had betrayed me at this most critical junction. My work is too important to let emotional attachments get in the way. I did the only sensible thing. Let history judge my actions...{^n}{^n} With the unfortunate distraction dealt with, I returned to my results. The human-snake hybrids had proven unstable and violent. I was assaulted on several occasions while attempting to study their physical functions, but those attacks proved to be little more than outbursts on the verge of death. All of the specimens died shortly after the procedure. Dissection revealed an incomplete hybridization of internal organs. With a dysfunctional digestive system, death was inevitable. But I wonder if perhaps the subjects were too old for the procedure to succeed. If I started over, with a younger candidate, then perhaps I would finally have the results I seek...{^n}{^n}                                                                       (4/4)

Only thing that'd give them away was the eyes. The eyes glowed that sickly aether-green. They offered me a chance to surrender, a chance to live out our lives as vessels and breeders for their growing army. I sent their heads back on spikes. See if those spirits survive that.{^n}{^n}But when they came back again, with new terms, well...then they were speaking my language. I was to be a piece in their grand design, a master of my very own army of aether-empowered humans.

For years, tales of supernatural occurrences have circulated about Wightmire and indeed the name itself makes one uneasy. I hadn't put much stock in them but my recent experiences lend some credence to the old tales.{^n}{^n}Nevertheless, I have reached my destination and it seems the Warden of Devil's Crossing, who resides in Burrwitch, somehow anticipated my arrival.

Every day, I set out to some destination in or around Burrwitch to investigate yet another unusual crime or ominous rumor. Some are easily dismissed as more mundane human crimes or merely fantastic tales, but many of my investigations have come to darker conclusions. I feel there is a pattern emerging here but I cannot yet put the pieces together.{^n}{^n}These are peripheral cases though and the main purpose of my involvement in them is to give pretense for my prolonged stay in Burrwitch. Krieg himself has become the focus of my primary investigation. Despite an overwhelming conviction that Krieg is not what he appears to be and is almost certainly involved in some sort of unnatural activity, I have found no irrefutable evidence of wrongdoing that could be used to open an official inquisition.{^n}{^n}Much of the manor itself is closed off to me. There are rooms upstairs from which Krieg and other visitors come and go but I am not permitted to enter. Stranger yet, I've awoken in the night to sounds like the creaking of wagons moving along a road but then looked out my window down upon the village and seen nothing.

From the way he spoke, it is clear that this is only some small part of a much greater conspiracy and I suspect many other persons in key positions have been possessed by things akin to that which now inhabits Krieg. I was arrogant in my initial handling of Krieg and seriously misjudged the power and scale of the threat we are faced with.{^n}{^n}Fortunately, Krieg's own arrogance has likewise led him to misjudge the resourcefulness of his prisoner.

A few awkward reunions made it painfully obvious that years on the road carrying out my duties as an inquisitor had left me out of touch and unable to discern whether any changes were the result of possession, or just the passage of time and faded memories. The only gamble left then was to report back to the citadel of the Luminari and see what came of it. I never made it there.{^n}{^n}Waiting until the sunlight dwindled and crowds thinned in the streets below, I rose to leave but was quite startled to see that a shadowy figure had somehow silently breached my room, evading all of the wards set against intruders. This is how I came into cooperation with the First Blade.{^n}{^n}                                                                      (7/10)
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA08codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - Entry 8
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA08Text=It was known that anyone of significance who fomented discontent or posed a real threat to the rule of the emperor might be visited by the First Blade. I had never stirred such controversy but I always imagined, if such an encounter took place, I could put up a respectable fight. I never got the chance. Taken unawares, I was disarmed before I even knew what was happening. Had he sought my death, I would not have even witnessed the killing stroke fall. However, he seemed more interested in answers instead and, in turn, provided me with an account of his own events that confirmed my worst fears.{^n}{^n}The First Blade revealed that, only days prior, he had been forced to turn his knives on the Emperor himself, by his own command. Despite the myriad safeguards protecting the Emperor, both mundane and arcane, he had become host to an Aetherial. Through strength of mind, he had usurped his possessor long enough to summon the First Blade, command his own execution and charge the assassin with ensuring that his son, the young prince, survive to reclaim the throne.{^n}{^n}His last commands issued, the Emperor's consciousness slipped once again under the control of the Aetherial and a desperate battle ensued. The First Blade reported that he believed the Emperor and the Aetherial within him slain but, given his inexperience with the entities, could not say anything for certain. He relayed that he had secretly taken the prince and put him into hiding but declined to elaborate. The First Blade said he intended to retire his imperial title and had chosen the name Ulgrim, which made me curious as to whether it was an intentional reference to the mythic character.{^n}{^n}A final troubling detail was that no proclamation of the Emperor's passing had been issued. Not only did this demonstrate the Aetherials had sufficient control of the palace to conceal the death but, given that they couldn't hope to hide the Emperor's absence for long, it suggested the next phase of their operation was imminent.{^n}{^n}I strategized with Ulgrim long into the night, formulating a plan to counter the Aetherials, but ultimately we agreed that we could not defeat their conspiracy in time. The only course left was gather whatever people and resources we could, go to ground and weather the coming storm; then find a way to counter the invaders.{^n}{^n}We agreed that the Black Legion would be our best hope in securing allies. As a conscripted army of criminals, debtors and political dissidents bound to service, it seemed unlikely that the Aetherials would have any reason to infiltrate them when they could control them indirectly through the military high command. The next step was to discretely make contact.{^n}{^n}                                                                      (8/10)

It is only in man's nature to fear what he does not understand and our art is no different. Necromancy was never held in high regard in Arkovian society, but it is only in recent years that we have been treated with such growing animosity.{^n}{^n}Now with the recent formal decree from the high court we are not just outcasts, we are criminals. What they fail to understand is that the only crime committed that day was against the pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of our people. Already they are rounding up my brethren under the guise of justice and taking them deep into their den of torture they call the Steps of Torment.

With a shaking hand I uncovered the bundle to reveal the motionless face of her infant child. It was dead for no more than a day at most. Her pleading eyes locked into mine, but I could not do what she asked of me. With great sorrow, I turned her away.{^n}{^n} Had I done as she had asked, the child would become a monster, an abomination not fit for this world.

tagLoreObj_WardensLabA01Text=It is unclear why the Aetherials are so interested in tissue preservation. One of my colleagues has posited that they may intend to use human corpses as vessels for possession when they bring more of their kind into our realm.{^n}{^n}Wagon loads of corpses continue to stream in day and night. The sheer quantity is staggering and I begin to suspect that they are not merely executed criminals as we've been told.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/3)
tagLoreObj_WardensLabA02Text=We entered stage two of our trials today but the results were not what I had anticipated.  We've progressed to the point where the corpses can endure for months, possibly years, with minimal, mostly external, deterioration. Our Aetherial overseer seemed satisfied and he, or it, unexpectedly placed his hand upon one of the corpses and released a spark of aetherial energy. The thing began to move as if it were alive again. It was a ghastly sight.{^n}{^n}What I found far more troubling though is that these corpses are clearly not meant to serve as Aetherial hosts. It has become known to me that they prefer living hosts. The sheer number of corpses they are hauling through here suggests a far worse realization: an army.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/3)

I fear that if they find my body, they will use me for their experimentations, so I must be discreet.

You cannot resist returning to this place; I know that the memories of that night still conjure nightmares in your sleep. The face you saw, that is the price one pays for learning the truth. Truth which you deny!{^n}{^n}Do you remember how we used to play around the old ruins as children? Father always told us not to, that we would be swept away by the harpies that fill the sky in the twilight hours. But what if he was not just trying to protect us? Perhaps there were ulterior motives to keeping us away from the old places of the world? What if, should we venture inside, we would learn more about his past than he wished for us to know?{^n}{^n}I have done what you could not, Daila. I have defied our father and entered the depths of Anguish. It is there that my eyes were truly opened.

tagQuestItem_Dravis_A02Text=Daila,{^n}by now you must have seen the haunting echoes from Arkovia's past. Have you never wondered how all this came to be? How Arkovia really fell? Father called it greed, but greed alone cannot condemn a man to such torment. Nay, powerful sorcery was at play here.{^n}{^n}I could feel it in the very walls. The stones screamed with unfettered rage, rage towards...me. Do the dead despise the living so? Do they yearn after what was stolen from them? To exist in such a state of endless limbo would drive any soul mad, but I do not believe that madness is what inspired this response. There was something familiar within these stones.{^n}{^n}I have to learn more. So I intend to visit the one place I know our father had been: our childhood home. Of course, this presents me with a bit of a challenge, as you well know why, for our home was consumed by the Chthonian rifts not long ago.

tagQuestItem_Dravis_A03Text=Daila,{^n}The pieces are finally falling into place. The answers were under our very noses all along. The rift violently consumed our home, but in doing so it revealed what was hidden from us underneath the floorboards. Our father kept a journal, a seemingly innocuous object, yet the pages were sealed from me with a protective rune.{^n}{^n}Carelessly, or perhaps arrogantly, I dispelled the seal. The resulting flames consumed the book and marked my face with embers that refuse to extinguish. It is agonizing, but I will endure. Despite our father's efforts, I was able to rescue some pages from the inferno. He told us that our mother died in childbirth, that much is true, but what you do not know is that we were not the first. There were other women, and other children, but the dates...they did not make any sense. It was not until I turned to the final page that the answer became clear.{^n}{^n}I must make haste to the City of the Dead. Therein lies our final clue...{^n}{^n}Dravis{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/4)

I think he's right and I suppose that's why I keep coming back to this journal.{^n}{^n}He's usually right, I've learned that more and more since we left the city. "The city is too crowded my love, we should leave this place and make our home in the countryside", he said, and so we did. We just packed up whatever we could carry and walked out through the city gates. I was terrified. I couldn't imagine where or how we'd live out here.

tagGDX1LoreObj_InquisitorCreedA09Text=With the help of the Taken, we've dealt a serious blow to the Cult of Ch'thon. I don't want to diminish the immensity of such a triumph, especially given the small force and limited resources we're working with but I fear it has come at great cost. While our attention was focused on denying the Loghorrean entrance to this world, the Aetherials were certainly not idle.{^n}{^n}Many in Devil's Crossing have paid the ultimate price but such is the way of war and it may sound callous to say but we traded well. Losing only a handful while preventing a monstrosity from escaping the void that could have heralded the end of the world as we know it is a win for humanity.{^n}{^n}What disturbs me though is the loss of Ulgrim to the void. Bourbon apparently does not share my concern and I think he sees it as ill-afforded sentiment on my part. Bourbon sees Ulgrim as merely a man but I am certain there is more to him. I believe he is an ascendant, a man who has become a demi-god.{^n}{^n}Ulgrim expertly plays the part of a jovial and unassuming character but his eyes say much more. He makes off-handed references to historical events with details and a familiarity of someone recalling a personal memory. For all his outward jocularity, there is gravity to him and it is clear he has witnessed much; I suspect more than one could experience in a single lifetime.{^n}{^n}Yet, for all that, and despite his obvious efforts to downplay it, Ulgrim possesses remarkable strength and energy for the middle-aged man he appears to be. He often carries himself in a relaxed, casual manner, moving languidly; but at rare moments, I have seen him react and move with impossible speed.{^n}{^n}I feel that he could do much more than he has, in fighting the enemies of man but I am not sure why he is holding back. Perhaps we will never know now. Maybe Bourbon is right, perhaps Ulgrim is lost to the void. Somehow though, I feel we will see him again and, if we do, it would go a long way toward confirming my suspicions.{^n}{^n}Then again, strange times are these, where a nameless wretch, cut down from the noose, has risen to become possibly the greatest hero of our time.{^n}{^n}If the Taken continues on this path and survives this war, I wonder if perhaps they too are on the path of ascendancy.{^n}{^n}                                                                      (9/10)

I find it impossible now to dismiss the idea that he is indeed the Ulgrim of legend and an immortal ascendant.{^n}{^n}As much as I am grateful to have such a powerful ally in this war, I cannot help but feel a little on edge when he is present. Between Ulgrim and the recent rumors of Mogdrogen, I am concerned that other divinities may also begin involving themselves in worldly affairs; as it is said they did more commonly in ancient times.{^n}{^n}This leads me back to the lingering mystery of Kymon. It is apparent that he and his followers are drawing power from some godlike force, but who or what? I am very doubtful of Kymon's claim that it is Empyrion that guides him, as he initially suggested. The power I sensed in Kymon's emissary to Homestead had a feeling of...malevolence to it.{^n}{^n}Kymon was once a brethren inquisitor, but he went rogue in the years before the Grim Dawn. He is clearly not Aetherial, but I fear he's entered into some manner of dark pact with an unknown power. Certainly if Empyrion, the high-god of legend, returned to Cairn, a power such as that would be felt on a larger scale than merely one raving fanatic leading a group of vagabonds.{^n}{^n}None the less, whatever entity is behind Kymon's Chosen, clearly it does possess significant power and I am troubled, not knowing its identity or motivations.{^n}{^n}                                                                    (10/10)

Lost in these endless dunes, I no longer favor my chances.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/3)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_CairanDocksNoteA02Text=I must admit, this place is truly a jewel in the desert. In my travels I have been to the farthest reaches of the world, seen and experienced much, sadly most sights did not live up to their own tales. This place, however, is a marvel that exceeds even the grandest of stories. Transcribing its beauty and grandeur may prove challenging even for me.{^n}{^n}I arrived via ship at the Cairan Docks late last night. My charter, a merchant vessel called Spire, packed to the gunwale with fine goods from distant shores; its captain, a stalwart and grizzled sailor whose dedication and leadership shone through in the motivation of his crew. Like a finely tuned machine they deftly navigated the dangerous waters west of the Korvan River delta.{^n}{^n}We first spotted the grand port while still at sea, miles before entering the river where it is located. The Cairan beacon shone brightly over the horizon. I do not know what magic powers that ubiquitous signal but its intense light draws vessels from the seas like moths to a flame. As we sailed upriver, the port began to reveal itself to us like an eager maiden. Countless warm yellow lights gently illuminated polished sandstone structures, some more than five stories tall. Beautifully crafted statues and fountains proudly stood watch over the gardens and public spaces that flowed through the grand bazaar.{^n}{^n}The port itself was ablaze with activity. Containers hoisted to and from ships, dock workers and merchants closing deals and crews taking leave in bars and fine brothels. Mere moments after I set foot on solid ground, for the first time in weeks, I was greeted by my local contact. A beautiful woman of middling age with an effortless and enticing gait further enhanced by the lovely gold embroidered gown that hung over her figure like a graceful waterfall. She guided me away from the pier to the heart of the port city, and my lodging for the night; which I politely offered to share with her, an advance she graciously denied. Not even this could dampen my mood however and, albeit alone, I had the greatest night of sleep in my life. The bazaar gently rocked me to sleep with the melodic hum of its ceaseless activity.{^n}{^n}This morning, my path takes me north to the capital, Korvan City. I shall join a small caravan that travels there daily along the immaculate stone roads leading to the heart of the city from the four cardinal directions. I can see the path now, as I sit and wait in the lovely garden bower just outside my lodging. Its stonework shines in the gentle morning sun. Immaculate golden leafed braziers mark its boundaries as far as the eye can see.{^n}{^n}If the next leg of my journey rivals the first, it shall truly be the experience of a lifetime.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/7)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_CairanDocksNoteA04Text=Sadly my time here has come to an end, and I find myself back at the Cairan Docks where I first embarked on this a most magnificent journey. I met once again with my captivating local contact. Katrice is her name, I've learned. And as if this marvelous place were eager to grant me a parting gift, she agreed to share in my final night's lodging.{^n}{^n}Tomorrow I shall once again board the merchant ship Spire and depart for distant shores. My destination, Cape Erine and the untamed lands that lie beyond. There I will attempt to make contact with the indigenous peoples and study their deep understanding of herbal medicine and insatiable penchant for human sacrifice.{^n}{^n}Wherever my travels take me I shall certainly cherish my time here in the Korvan Basin.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (7/7)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_CairanDocksNoteA06Text=Day - 29{^n}It has been two tedious and nerve wracking days since we made landfall. Our time is spent cautiously picking our way through arid canyons and barren valleys with no sign of civilization. We are forced to travel huddled together with armed guards at our flanks, a cumbersome but necessary measure. One of our porters was mauled by an unknown predator while relieving himself. We must be incredibly cautious to prevent further attacks.{^n}{^n}I am no expert in the study of animals but I have witnessed many here that defy my understanding of the natural world. Massive reptiles skulking in the dunes. Flying predators with wingspans as large as a ship. Beetle-like insects the size of a man. This is a place of deep primordial energy, I feel certain we are on the right path.{^n}{^n}Day - 31{^n}Today we have reached the first true evidence of civilization. The lotus symbolism and crumbled remains of guardian statues that I've previously only seen depicted in texts made it abundantly clear that these were indeed the remnants of the Korvan people. Around midday, we walked clear of the insipid and deathly dry desert and there laid out before us were the sprawling ruins of a once glorious city. Beyond the sand covered husks of buildings, I could make out the remnants of a massive port and the bones of ancient ships now resting on the dry salt bed. There was no doubt about it. These were the Cairan Docks, the port that connected Korvan City to the luxurious trade routes that brought power and riches untold to these shores. Beyond it the now barren bay that served as its connection to the outside world. Our efforts are paying off, we are now on the path once trod by the Eldritch Sun himself.{^n}{^n}Day - 32{^n}We've uncovered an ancient bathhouse and temple complex at the center of the port city. Our accompaniment insisted on exploring the ruins and carefully cataloguing every grain of sand that appeared unique to them. I tried to impress upon them that this was not the intended destination of our expedition and that it was not the time for delays, not when we were so near, not after so many years of preparation. I will not allow their petty attempts to recover meaningless artifacts to stall our progress.{^n}{^n}Perhaps the time for more drastic action has come. I will speak with Roderick in private, beyond prying eyes. We will reach an agreement as to the appropriate next steps.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/5)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_EndlessDungeonNoteA01Text=Cast your eyes upon the splendors of Ralyoth and bear witness to the price of defiance, for by our own actions we forged our doom.{^n}{^n}As tendrils of the great darkness rip and tear at our world, as we stare into our oblivion, one truth stands above all others: when our ancestors cast out our god they sealed our fate. As I look up at the star-less sky and the subtle writhing of the devourer, I find myself reminiscing of brighter days. Days when the children would run in the streets and laugh instead of cowering in cellars with their parents, awaiting the inevitable. Gone are the boisterous calls of the bazaar, the chatter of folk going about their day. We've all fallen silent. Some resort to prayer to any god that would listen; but none will answer for we had forgotten their names.{^n}{^n}Such was the decree of our ancestors. Their words painted the divines as cruel, malicious and petty; but if it was by their will that our land exists, that we exist, what price is too high? Did our ancestors feel justified in their acts? In my final moments, I seek answers to these questions.{^n}{^n}None barred my way as I entered the royal library. The guards were long gone, searching for solace amongst their families and peers. Some of the archivists remained, unable to break routine even in our end of days. Quizzingly, they pointed me to the tomes I required, they felt no need to deny me knowledge at a time like this.{^n}{^n}What I uncovered shook me to the very core and opened my eyes to the hubris and defiance of our people...{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/3)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_EndlessDungeonNoteA02Text=All that we see, the animals that we breed for meat, the trees we harvest of their fruit, all were a gift of a nameless god. All this was bestowed upon us and but one thing was asked in return: worship.{^n}{^n}The radiant entity stood before the first of our people, its light brighter than a star in the sky, and demanded fealty. Its arrival was heralded by a breathtaking meteor shower. All were in awe of their benefactor. All kneeled.{^n}{^n}Monuments were erected in its honor. The finest artists argued over which materials were most worthy of capturing a divine's countenance. Temples were constructed by the sweat and blood of our people. A grand ziggurat was built at the heart of Ralyoth to stand as the celestial's throne and fanatic worshippers sacrificed themselves upon the temple steps to gain the god's favor.{^n}{^n}But as our society flourished and our people spread out across the vast lands created for them, they became discontent. The blessings of the divine were no longer witnessed by all. The boons of the harvest were not felt on the outer reaches of our empire. Disease became more common as our cities grew crowded.{^n}{^n}The people's ire was placed upon their divine. They felt that their worship warranted greater blessings, that the sacrifices their ancestors made earned them the right to a blissful existence. For a time, it seems the god was willing to appease its people, but as it granted boons to one group, another grew angry that their prayers were not answered first. Unrest became commonplace. Citizens turned to crime where once the land provided all they desired. And as they turned their backs upon the very god that gave them everything, the divine grew silent and reclusive.{^n}{^n}What I find peculiar in these retellings is that not once was the god's name uttered, and a few places I could find that referred to it directly had been blotted out with black ink. Our ancestors, it appears, were thorough in erasing evidence of its existence.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/3)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_EndlessDungeonNoteA03Text=The earth beneath my feet trembles and the few candles I have left are all the light I have by which to read these tomes and record my final hours. The archivists too have fled. To where, I do not know. Nowhere remains that is safe from the hungering darkness.{^n}{^n}My reading has brought me to the chronicles of the defining moment in our people's history, the day we vanquished a god. The date of this event is unclear, but it had to have been at least several generations ago as nobody I've known had been alive to witness it.{^n}{^n}The texts describe the final years of the divine's presence as tumultuous. The stars grew dimmer and the god was almost never seen outside the ziggurat. Some stopped worshipping it entirely, convinced that they had been forsaken and left to their own devices. Angry mobs took to the streets. Monuments were toppled, shrines desecrated. Temples burned.{^n}{^n}Discontent turned to riots and the riots into an angry mob that marched towards the grand ziggurat. Priests concocted powerful runes, the arcanists crafted spells they hoped could subdue a god. With death in their eyes, the people climbed the steps to the divine's throne. There they found it, angered by the desecration and revolt, but its once brilliant light had faded. The divine stood, towering above the people, and demanded fealty; but none bent the knee. Evidently infuriated by this defiance, the god cursed the very land and its people and vanished in an eruption of flames that toppled the ziggurat and claimed the lives of all that dared confront their deity.{^n}{^n}Ralyoth was rid of its divine. Its name was scoured from all records, all art. Its monuments were toppled and disfigured. The temple was left abandoned for nature to reclaim.{^n}{^n}What followed were months of grieving for the brave souls lost at the ziggurat interspersed with celebration and feasts. Our once god was all but forgotten. It was not until centuries later when our star faded and the hungering darkness encroached that we realized what our ancestors had truly done.{^n}{^n}As I sit here under the waning light of my candles, I ponder a future where we are still under the heel of a celestial being. Not knowing the repercussions, would we, as our ancestors did, resent our god? Or would we show greater appreciation for the lands and boons we were given? As the darkness takes me, my thoughts spin with questions of what if, but there is no one left to answer...{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/3)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvaakNoteA02Text=We do not know where he hails from. Nobody we spoke to knows him. What drew this sorcerer to our lands confounds us, but it is his disregard for our ways, our very faith, that brought him to my attention.{^n}{^n}I've received numerous complaints of this...Solael visiting religious sites and temples and showing utter disregard for procedure or ritual. It is almost as if he's searching for something, but what? I cannot say. His private home in the outer reaches of the Cairan Docks, acquired with a satchel of foreign gold, I am told, has been sighted giving off an eerie glow in the middle of the night, much like the divine's Eldritch light. I feel that it is only a matter of time before he conjures his own undoing by delving into matters he is not meant to and drawing the ire of the Eldritch Sun.{^n}{^n}I know not what folly the sorcerer plans, but he is quickly becoming a danger to the Korvan faith and a menace to its people. We must not let dissidents unravel what is presently a fragile situation. With the Eldritch Sun silent and none allowed to seek his providence, we must take these matters into our hands.{^n}{^n}I've dispatched the temple's elite guard to handle this concern. Nobody's going to miss a reclusive sorcerer; and besides, he is a stranger to these lands after all. What's one more unidentified body in the river...{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/4)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvaakNoteA03Text=Blindly have I stared beyond the curtain of reality. Agony met me partway. Beyond...magnificence.{^n}{^n}For my achievement, I was punished. My wounds weep, but my eyes are open. That was to be my gift, my bane, for staring into the Eldritch Sun. Dutifully, I kept others at bay for centuries, filled their minds with horrors and visions of their own demise that they not repeat my mistakes.{^n}{^n}Yet this one confounds me. He is undisturbed, driven, power-hungry. The priests made threats, and he laughed in their faces. Such arrogance in a such a fragile fleshy thing. And yet, he is brimming with potential.{^n}{^n}My open eyes peer through the possibilities. The one that holds the leash is wounded, broken. Given these circumstances and enough attempts, the mortal may eventually succeed in satisfying his hunger. But would his reign be any more just? His heart is as black as the writhing darkness, but he is not mad; he could be reasoned with.{^n}{^n}Many roads to follow, but only one shines clearly before me, but one leads to my ultimate victory. The Eldritch Sun must set, and a new order must rise in its stead: the sorcerer, the priestess and the guardian, equal and not. Yes, it will not be enough to merely bring the sorcerer to his goal. The Everliving Flame needs to be extinguished from the path. His immortal heart shattered by betrayal; and the one that wraps her web around his very soul will be the very same that binds our prize.{^n}{^n}No doubts remain in the infinity. My course is set. Now I must merely ensure that the other pieces fall in line. All other threads will be cut, until the one true path remains...the path of Dreeg.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/4)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvaakNoteA04Text=Tragic is the tale of Ulzuin the Everliving Flame, the right hand of the Eldritch Sun, for none have suffered as ruthless a betrayal as he. A warrior at heart, Ulzuin was restless with his newfound duties of keeping vigil over the Temple of the Eldritch Sun; for what mortal could hope to threaten a god?{^n}{^n}And so he entertained himself within his temple, consuming wine and concubines faster than his attendants could hope to supply. That was until the priestess Bysmiel attracted his attention. Her generous curves moved with confidence through the halls and her emerald eyes captivated the god, but it was her silky voice that got her invited to his chambers.{^n}{^n}There she stayed, sometimes for days, to the chagrin of the temple priests. Ulzuin was enthralled by the young priestess, shirking his duties and ignoring the complaints of his attendants. Nobody but Bysmiel was allowed near him and none but her would be allowed to fill his lonely nights of vigil. That lust ultimately proved to be his undoing for it was then that Ulzuin learned the true danger of mortals.{^n}{^n}It was on the fateful day when the earth ruptured and the sky turned to flame that Ulzuin realized his folly. Bysmiel had promised him a glorious surprise, an indulgence unlike any he had yet experienced in his many lifetimes, which left Ulzuin recklessly far from Korvan City and the Temple of the Eldritch Sun. Sensing the upheaval, Ulzuin rushed back to his post, but he was far too late. The city was consumed by fire and the great temple had been claimed by another.{^n}{^n}Ulzuin howled at the sky, calling out to his father, Empyrion, for aid. But the skies were silent. In blinding agony and rage, Ulzuin flattened his temple and inflicted a wound upon the world that burns to this day, just as the wound Bysmiel left upon his heart remains still. But where the vengeful god is now, perhaps only the Witch Gods know.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/4)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvaakNoteA05Text=Let me regale to you the tale of Korvan's fall. For when the gods did battle and the world shook in their wake, it was the people of Korvan that paid the price of ambition.{^n}{^n}With Ulzuin off in distant lands, the Temple of the Eldritch Sun was infiltrated, aided by treachery. The many-eyed fiend, the guardian of the hidden realm, clouded the minds of the temple's attendants and allowed two figures, a sorcerer and a priestess, to pass through unhindered. Together they crossed the gate to a reality beyond mortal words, the realm of the Eldritch Sun. There they found the primordial being gathering strength upon his throne.{^n}{^n}The sorcerer spared no time in unleashing his assault upon the wounded god. All the while the priestess cast her bindings upon him and the infinite gaze filled his mind with visions of terror. The celestial being thrashed against his restraints and lashed out at his attackers, and as he did so the land above crumbled and spat fire. The air filled with sulfur and the Korvan people fled for safety. The seas evaporated and rivers were replaced with molten rock, for the Korvan lands were as bound to the fate of Korvaak as flesh is to bone.{^n}{^n}For every injury the god sustained from the sorcerer's onslaught, a violent eruption shook the basin and engulfed its people; as he strained against the priestess's bindings, so the earth crumbled and changed; and as the guardian's visions consumed his very thoughts, so the Korvan people were ensnared by madness and nightmares.{^n}{^n}When at last the tremors subsided and the survivors looked up from amongst the ashes, they saw not one figure descending the temple steps in triumph, but three. And the fate of Cairn was forever changed.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (4/4)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvanCityNoteA03Text=I arrived today at the heart of Korvan City after a grueling three days of travel, a journey which began on a high note as we traversed the lush oasis just beyond the walls of the Cairan Docks. The Korvan capital is something else entirely. Lush stands of palms grace the shores of flowing streams fed by subterranean springs, which bubble up from the depths with an irrepressible ferocity. In the midst of a stark desert it is truly a sight to behold.{^n}{^n}I've been told that this one source provides the cleanest of waters to the region. Apparently an entire class of water merchants exists, with the sole duty of collecting the life-giving nectar from there and distributing it throughout the land.{^n}{^n}This is also where I had my first exposure to the curious and deep-rooted faith of the region. My traveling companions, the daily caravan from Cairan Docks to Korvan City, insisted that we stop at a temple, known as the Sanctuary of Horran, positioned in the heart of the oasis. It was apparently crucial that they stop while the burning sun was at its highest point, the prescribed hour to observe a daily ritual in which they give thanks to their god for his mercy and pittance.{^n}{^n}I can understand why a culture surrounded by such harsh and unforgiving lands would be grateful for whatever it is that has graced them to create such a stunning civilization. However, I quickly learned to be wary of these rituals as the prescribed hour for worship is not one but several a day. I know now why the journey to Korvan City takes three days.{^n}{^n}On the second day of our journey we passed through a smaller city on the outskirts of Korvan. This was truly an unusual locale. It appeared to be more temple than practical residence. I surmise it is a center for religious practice, perhaps where the local faith's most devout followers can go about their various rituals unhindered by the bustle of Korvan proper. Just beyond the temple city lies a vast network of tombs. I was told, by one of the caravan's drivers, that previous Korvan leaders and powerful devotees of the Korvan faith are buried there along with countless precious relics. Apparently the valley was chosen as a burial site because the roiling hot blood of their god flows close to the surface there. I suspect there is an ancient magma flow passing beneath the valley, perhaps the remnants of a long dormant volcano.{^n}{^n}These revelations are quite curious and worthy of further investigation. I shall hope to learn a great deal more about this faith, its practices and practitioners during my time in Korvan City.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/7)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvanCityNoteA04Text=Today was my first full day in Korvan City and I must say I am as awestruck by its majesty as I was when I first landed at the Cairan Docks. The focal point of the city is a grand temple dedicated to the Eldritch Sun, Korvaak, a deity I am unfamiliar with but one that dominates local theology. The temple's majesty is indescribable. It seems to dwarf everything in sight, even nearby mountains. And it radiates with such an energy that its heat can be felt even in the midday sun. Even I, a skeptic, find myself in sheer admiration. I've been told that the heat of the temple had dwindled for some years but has recently rekindled, a cause for celebration and ritual. I suspect it is built on a geological feature, perhaps a volcano or hot spring of some sort. I should very much wish to gain access to the inside. Though, as I discovered by visiting several smaller temples around the city, this is unlikely to happen. The main temple holds particular importance and entry is strictly prohibited to outsiders.{^n}{^n}Though it appears to be the focal point of the local faith, Korvaak is by no means the only entity worshipped by the Korvan people. There also appear to be lesser gods whom the people call ascendants. What that means exactly, I am not clear on and nobody had a straight answer for me either. The stories regarding these individuals vary, and not all of them seem to be holy men or even devout practitioners.  By my observation, they may well be wealthy individuals that have bought their way to deification and the social reverence that comes with. Nonetheless, minor temples were constructed in their honor and they are all worshipped in their own right and for various means, sometimes even before death.{^n}{^n}I should very much like to know what qualifies a person for a place of such honor and so tomorrow I will be visiting several temples positioned around the main Temple of the Eldritch Sun. If birthright will not grant me access, then perhaps the grease of a few coins will.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/7)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvanCityNoteA05Text=Following today's investigation of the tombs and temples of Korvan City, I must say I am more confused and, frankly, enthralled by the Korvan faith than I could have possibly imagined.{^n}{^n}Today I had the privilege to bear witness to a ceremony at the Temple of Rahn, where the ascendant himself was present to perform the honorable rite. It is my understanding that Rahn holds domain over the sun itself and it is by his blessing that the sun rises each day to warm the earth and give life to the harvest. The ceremony itself was brief and involved the slaughter of five goats upon the golden altar, their blood spilled into the carving in the form of a many-pronged sun.{^n}{^n}Rahn was a splendor to behold, his skin as golden as the suit of armor he wore. The armor glowed with burning energy and yet, as some of the acolytes in the temple described to me from their blessed opportunities to lay their hands upon it, is cool to the touch. With the way he presents himself it is easy to see why his followers believe this man to be a deity. The acolytes tell me that this is actually the 12th incarnation of Rahn. His father was the 11th and so on down the patriarchal chain of his family. Each of them had allegedly lived for centuries, and each had willingly given his life in the service of the Eldritch Sun. I was astonished to discover that the deification of this figure was his birthright. It does however lend credence to my suspicions regarding the true nature of these Korvan gods.{^n}{^n}The acolytes of this temple were more than eager to share Rahn's history with me. I swear if I let them, they'd talk all day of his countless accomplishments and divine intervention. But what did catch my attention was the presumed rivalry between Rahn and another deity they call Ateph, the lord of the moon. As this rivalry heated up, Ateph, I've learned, had slighted the Eldritch Sun and was thus banished from setting foot in Korvan City or to ever again feel the warmth of day upon his flesh.{^n}{^n}But the divine Korvaak was not without mercy. Once every 30 cycles of the sun, the disgraced Ateph was to make pilgrimage to Korvan City and make an offering upon the grand temple steps. This is an extraordinary and incredibly creative explanation for the cycling of day and night and the wax and wane of the moon.{^n}{^n}If this strange practice of ascension weren't enough, the people of the Korvan valley also appear to deify native animals and sometimes odd combinations of people and animals. The Korvan gryphon is a particularly common target of this practice. The creatures apparently live in rigid hierarchical packs which elevate a singular, usually male, individual to an alpha known by the Korvan people as a Sovereign. These gryphon Sovereigns are then worshiped by locals as minor deities.{^n}{^n}The intricacies of the Korvan faith are remarkable but it must not go unmentioned that they all lead back to Korvaak in one fashion or another. I shall focus future investigations on this penultimate deity.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (4/7)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvanCityNoteA06Text=I can no longer count the days since I've first arrived in Korvan City. I have been so enveloped by my work that I've lost track of the rising and setting of the sun, Rahn would be so disappointed in me.{^n}{^n}I find it difficult to pull my attention away. I've hired a young man to bring me meals three times a day and I must admit they are piling up outside the door to my chambers. My time is spent poring over mountains of texts and tomes, rites and ceremonies in an attempt to better understand the origins of this Korvaak.{^n}{^n}What I have learned thus far is truly fascinating. As far back as I can go, there seems to be no inconsistency to his presence or domain, no evolution of his worship. It is as if the core of the Korvan religion had somehow remained pure since its inception, quite unusual. It is that or its founders had put a great deal of effort into obscuring its true origins. The texts I've perused make it seem as though their rites and rituals are performed today as they were when first prescribed centuries ago.{^n}{^n}According to these texts, Korvaak reigns over the Eldritch realm, a plane of existence in parallel to our own of his very making. They say that no mortal may bear witness upon its splendors and live; some fools have tried and paid the ultimate price for it. The texts warn of a many-eyed guardian that stands as a warning to all that would dare trespass upon the god's domain.{^n}{^n}Korvaak himself is said to be primordial, ancient and eternal, a progenitor of all that mankind cherishes. From his Eldritch Throne, the Korvan god ascended numerous champions to enforce his rule. He had even been known to elevate those that dare challenge his worship as a means to appease them, turning former foes into steadfast allies. The now familiar names of Rahn and Ateph came up several times in the various tales spun around Korvaak's divine actions. The history of the Korvan faith is indeed generations in the making.{^n}{^n}The Eldritch Sun is depicted both as the blessed flame and the dreadful terror of destruction. It seems he is both adored and feared by those that show him reverence, and with good reason; though Korvaak is generally depicted as benevolent to his followers, there are numerous records of disasters or outright cleansings that were attributed to the god's retribution for mortals displeasing him.{^n}{^n}Some of these events seem eerily familiar, though I cannot recall why. I suspect there are similar mythos which I have been exposed to in nearby regions. There are also a number of rituals which bear a remarkable similarity to primitive practices I have researched in the past.{^n}{^n}This leads me to wonder if there are other tribes and civilizations that have been worshiping Korvaak since antiquity, but perhaps by a different name. This is a matter which will necessitate further investigation.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (5/7)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvanCityNoteA07Text=I have made a startling discovery while on my latest foray into the Korvan texts. While exploring the vast collection of the Korvan City Library, I briefly escaped the attention of its stewards and found my way to a closed-off archive. Among ancient birth records of some of the most prestigious Korvan families, several ascendants included, I unearthed a collection of texts that appear to shatter some of the core tenets of the very faith that is central to these people's lives.{^n}{^n}A large number of the pages were badly damaged, as if whatever ward cast upon them had violently dissipated. Strangely, the parchment itself appeared newer than some of the records I've seen; perhaps someone had restored a damaged record at a later date. The bits that I could make out, however, painted a very different account of the early years of the Korvan faith.{^n}{^n}Korvaak himself was shown as a usurper, a conqueror of a realm he had no part in making. It is not entirely clear if the Korvaak that is spoken of today is even the same one described in those texts or whether that is the name given to the master of the Eldritch Throne.{^n}{^n}Another curiosity was the description of the upheaval involved in such a transition of power, a whirlwind of creation and destruction within which were caught the unfortunate believers. Sadly, before I could complete my analysis of the text, one of the stewards discovered my presence in the closed-off archive and promptly chased me out of the building.{^n}{^n}What little I've managed to read offers some troubling conclusions. Is Korvaak's rule destined to falter as it had before? If so, will the same destruction consume these people when it does? It is truly a shame that I could not spend more time with those texts as they represented a fantastic culmination of my research into the origins of the Korvan faith.{^n}{^n}Alas, I must prepare to leave this land and, though I have learned a great deal, I am certain there is more than a lifetime of knowledge hidden away here. The devotion and machinations of the Korvan people have proven to be one of my most fascinating studies.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (6/7)

This morning, as our cohorts made their way back into the bathhouse for yet another day of sorting and cataloguing the belongings of dead people, Roderick and I barred the doors shut from the outside. I'm brimming with glee to think of the looks on their faces as they return from a long day of graverobbing only to discover that their treasure trove shall also be their tomb.{^n}{^n}We are, of course, alone now and without protection. However, traveling will be easier with just the two of us and I have prepared a number of wards that should keep us well-hidden and protected from the ravenous wildlife.{^n}{^n}Onward to the temple and the burning heart of Korvan City!{^n}{^n}Day - 35{^n}I am awestricken. I stand here, after so desperate a journey, at the foot of a grand temple devoted to Korvaak. The city of his name stretches out in all directions. Its buildings in ruins, collapsed as if kneeling to pay tribute to the Eldritch god. The scars of his wrath run deep through the very foundations of the infrastructure, evidence of the cataclysm which claimed these people centuries ago. There are ancient rivers of stone now cooled and crystalized into black glass. Great upheavals of jagged rock which pierce buildings and form monuments to his anger. All lie in ruin but for the temple. There, at its heart we shall find what we have come for, a power immutable, a wealth greater than all of the riches of mankind.{^n}{^n}This we shall claim for ourselves.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (4/5)

What of the white-hot energy that once warmed the foundations of Korvan City?{^n}{^n}There is nothing, no revelation, no great power. The temple runs cold, its heart a hardened mass of blackened glass. The great god who once dwelt here is gone. To where? I do not know. His fate is irrelevant to me. I care only for the power that lingered here and it is all gone.{^n}{^n}I am alone now, a lifetime of work and friendship gone...wasted. Roderick lies dead, struck down by the ancient guardian of this place; the only indication that this place was ever worth a damn. Roderick gave his life so that I could reach the heart of the temple. His sacrifice was rendered pointless as the history that led us here proved to be no more than fables. I am certain a great power dwelt here once but it is long gone, perhaps claimed by another.{^n}{^n}There is nowhere left for me to go, no reason for me to pursue an existence beyond these walls. And so I shall perish here as well, with the knowledge that my life's work, my very purpose, was to waste. Or perhaps I should return to the guardian that felled my friend and allow it to take me as well, a final tribute to the Eldritch Sun of old.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (5/5)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvanPlateauNoteA01Text=The writings gathered here are to serve as record of our journey to reach the lost Korvan city.{^n}{^n}This expedition is the culmination of a lifetime of study by myself, Thomas Peterson and my esteemed colleague Roderick Krane. Together we have focused our efforts on ancient lore that speaks of a magnificent city of gold, hidden deep in the burning desert; a city whose people and culture vanished generations ago. By following the works of Rion the Scholar, sparse regional folklore and a number of cryptic religious texts, we were able to piece together a potential location for the lost city.{^n}{^n}From Rion's writings, we know that the main port of entry to the Korvan civilization was a place called the Cairan Docks, a massive coastal city positioned in a protective bay just inland of a large river delta. However, recovered Korvan folklore claims that the waters of this river delta and the protective bay where Cairan was situated turned to flame and were burned away during the supposed cataclysmic event that ended the civilization. After speaking with a number of shipping merchants and retired sailors we have pinpointed a location that fits this description. A strip of land where the desert meets the sea, just north of Cape Erine. The terrain and weather here are apparently so treacherous that few have ventured far from the coast.{^n}{^n}It should not go unmentioned that funding for our expedition was provided by a number of wealthy individuals from both Erulan and Malmouth. It does concern me that their interests in the lost city may not align with ours. And they have sent a retinue of individuals to monitor our progress and look after their investment. I am concerned that they may attempt to interfere if things don't seem to be going their way. Roderick assures me that, whatever their intentions, we will not allow them to waylay us from our goal. Though, I suspect he's told them they are likely to find some sort of treasure or otherwise valuable items to make it seem worth investing in our expedition.{^n}{^n}And so our journey begins.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/5)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvanPlateauNoteA02Text=Day - 23{^n}{^n}Until today, our journey has been an exercise in the mundane. I have lost track of time as I watch the ship's crew go about their routine day in and day out. I feel more than a bit useless but the captain has explained, a number of times, that our involvement will only make his crew less efficient. So I sit, read, watch the clouds pass overhead and review my notes over and over again.{^n}{^n}That all changed this morning shortly after dawn when I was violently awoken by the sound of cannon fire. The shattering boom gave me such a start that I fell out of my hammock. When I rushed above deck the scene was somewhere between utter chaos and military precision. Before I could determine what was happening the captain ordered Roderick and I below deck.{^n}{^n}Later when the fracas had subsided, I had a chance to speak with him. Evidently, the dawn watchman spotted another ship with no colors flying; a sure sign of piracy, the Captain said. Instead of risking an attack he decided to go on the offensive and begin firing as soon as the ship was in range. Whatever he did, it worked and the other ship fled. However, it appears this is a common tactic among pirates of the region. They follow ships and attempt an attack at night when the crew is less alert. I shudder to think that our expedition could have come to such a grisly end before we even reached the barren shores.{^n}{^n}Day - 27{^n}{^n}The captain tells me we're nearing our destination, no more than a day's sailing left and then an indeterminate number of days searching the desert for the lost city.{^n}{^n}The retinue of babysitters sent by our investors have been asking a number of peculiar questions about the burial habits of the Korvan people, and about the types of objects we might hope to find there; none of which I have answers to. I caught one of them reading an ancient-looking text of some sort the other day. Aurenial Arcanum, the name read. It is a volume I am unfamiliar with, though if I didn't know better I'd say it was exactly the kind of thing that could attract Luminari attention. He snatched the book closed and hid it in his jacket when I asked what he was reading. His scowl said it all.{^n}{^n}Peculiar indeed.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/5)

And then, when I walk to the edge, the jackal hit me from behind.{^n}{^n}I must have blacked out. When I awoke, I saw no light above. I've now wandered inside this forsaken place for hours and everything looks the same. I have no way to mark where I am or where to go. There must be some truth to the legends of this beast spanning the entirety of the basin. It is like a maze, except living...and writhing. And by the depths of nights, the smell; like week old vomit boiling beneath the desert sun.{^n}{^n}I've also taken note of several chambers filled with a sickly green fluid.

Now my skin tingles where it was exposed.{^n}{^n}I dread to think what would have happened if I had not awoken when I did. Would I have been devoured in my sleep, my senses dulled by the strange sludge? The horrid things retreated when I brandished my sword, but I know they are not far behind as I walk. They are in no rush to have their inevitable meal.{^n}{^n}I thought my loyalty to Tuha would be how I forged my name in the ranks of the temple guard. I must have angered the priests somehow. But what could I have done? I can think of no altercation that would have them do this to me. Unless this fate awaits all who know the location of the seals?{^n}{^n}How do two people keep a secret?

tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_RoguelikeNoteA05Text=I have arrived at my new post and completed my inspection of the fort and its troops. It is a small structure, but impressive in its armaments and the regiment's dedication to their assignment. I was told the fort has no formal name and I was not to issue it one. It is not a matter I intend to question as my orders were handed down from Vizier Erhaman himself.{^n}{^n} The regiment, known as the Blades of Ateph, is a formidable one. I have watched them spar and their skills in combat are frightening. But this comes as no surprise. They've all been trained from a young age as both assassins and soldiers. I have no doubt they will make for excellent guardians should we face any threats.{^n}{^n}The fort's most notable feature is the long double bridge built over water that flows in from the ocean. Beyond it lies the vault I am to guard with my life. As to what it contains, I was not given specifics, only that the object in question had not yet arrived.{^n}{^n}I'm not going to jeopardize my fortunes by asking too many questions.

He asked to have his entourage put up for the duration of their stay, which of course I agreed to.{^n}{^n}After a night's rest he asked to be shown the premises, culminating in the underground chamber. As we made our way through the fort, I pointed out various features and soldiers of note. Priest Tuha showed little interest. Later on, he interrupted a demonstration by the Blades and asked to be shown across the bridge.{^n}{^n}I shudder every time I cross that expanse. Despite my training, I cannot help but fear falling over the edge. The water below would break my fall, but there is no way back should I survive its icy depths. Once beyond the bridge, Tuha became very interested. He examined every rock, every crevice, pushing and pulling on bits of the mosaic adorning the walls. He was searching for weaknesses, I presume.{^n}{^n}We spent the remainder of the day there, I sent for food several times, but he touched little of it. Finally, late into the night, he was satisfied. Of what, I could not say. And I dare not ask.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/3)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_RoguelikeNoteA07Text=On the following day, Priest Tuha had his entourage move in a large stone chest adorned with a gryphon. It did not appear to have any hinges or lid. Whatever was inside, it was heavy. It took a team of twenty mighty men working tirelessly all day to move it. By the end, their backs glistened with sweat and blood from their toils.{^n}{^n}Once the casket was in place, the priest instructed them to go rest on the bridge. As they made their way down, Tuha motioned with his scepter and several of the Blades of Ateph descended upon them. They moved swiftly and mercilessly. Within moments, all the workers were bleeding out on the bridge stone, their throats slit before they even realized what had transpired.{^n}{^n}Tuha ordered their bodies to be weighed down with rocks and dumped into the waters churning below. The harshness and brutality were so sudden, I briefly watched in stunned silence, but then it occurred to me...the Blades did not follow my orders. They followed his.{^n}{^n}The priest gathered what remained of his caravan, a mere handful of soldiers. I suspect they too were Blades of Ateph. I followed them back to the surface and inquired as to where the caravan was heading next. To that, he said "Someplace deep that light has forsaken." He then gave me a look that made my blood run cold; a look that told me I should not ask such questions unless I wanted to join the rest of his caravan in the black waters below.{^n}{^n}Each night as I stand watch atop the fortress ramparts, I am reminded of the carnage that took place beneath and the chilling realization that I am honor-bound to die in this place sets in.

If the Korvan people are to be truly free from this darkness, then none can know of where the seals lie hidden. In that, I have offered myself for no other could be entrusted with this grave duty.

It is only natural to fear this emptiness, this absence of all things, but if you give yourself fully to unraveling its secrets, we will surpass even the gods the priesthood claims to speak for.{^n}{^n}Do not mistake my enthusiasm for rash action, however.

Creatures of the night that would be a natural sight in any other part of the basin are distorted and wrong here.

Scores of my men vanished in an instant. Others were torn apart by hungering tentacles.{^n}{^n}But by the light of the Eldritch Sun, we were triumphant. What bit of darkness these fools tapped into has been expunged by fire and their forsaken souls trapped by the priests. They will know no rest.

I have seen it in the eyes of the men. A harrowed look. Pale and wide eyed. Last night, the whole of the camp was awoken by a ghastly shrieking. One of my captains was carving his own arm like a meat shank, screaming about the bugs under his skin. Several others had wandered off without a word to their superiors. We never saw them again.{^n}{^n}Further tragedy struck as we neared Morgoneth's foul altar. One of the temple stewards, a mighty construct blessed by the Eldritch Sun, suddenly collapsed as unearthly tendrils wrapped themselves around its legs. Several of my men approached to investigate only to find themselves at the mercy of our very ally. The steward rose again, but its eyes no longer shone with the brilliance of the temple fire. Instead, they were the black of the abyss, claimed by the foulness threatening to consume us all.{^n}{^n}Those nearest to the steward were the first to fall, cleaved in two by its mighty halberd. Several more turned to ash when the construct exhaled the void itself. Ironically, it would be the very blessings of the Eldritch Sun that proved the steward's undoing. With a fiery rune emblazoned in the air, I forced the guardian to the edge of nothingness and several of our magi blasted it with spells and sent it plummeting into the same void that now controlled it.{^n}{^n}If such corruption can claim even our mightiest guardians, then by the light of Rahn, we must hurry.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (4/4)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_RoguelikeNoteD02Text=It is as I told you, my brothers and sisters in darkness. The betrayers inevitably learned of our actions and they come, oh they come. They bring their runes and their constructs of mortal war, but they will soon learn that one cannot defy the ultimate truth. The abyss calls to us all. We may fight it, resist it, but in the end, we will all be consumed by it. The gods learned this truth long ago and even they must ultimately submit. Their stars will not defy their fate forever.{^n}{^n}The conduit of eternal night is complete. Its unlight will bask the stars in shadow and usher in the unmaking. It matters not what happens to us this day, the betrayers at the temple are too late. The barrier is no more. The great devourer has tasted of our bounty and will be held back no longer.{^n}{^n}They may rip and tear at our flesh; they may even triumph over our mortal forms, but they have not peered into the abyss as we have. They know nothing of what awaits, and what is yet to come.{^n}{^n}Go forth into eternity, my magi.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (3/3)

tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_TombsNoteA04Text=We set out yesterday to make our way over the charred rim and down into the valley below. It is a wild place where towering basalt formations jut from the ground like the bones of an ancient beast. I don't know what happened here but it appears as if the earth turned itself inside out, spewing its jagged entrails across the valley floor. The land rests now but signs of ancient turmoil abound.{^n}{^n}I must say I am pleasantly surprised to find that Amal's map has been accurate. When he bought the old rag from a wandering junk peddler and then tried to convince me to join his little treasure hunt I was skeptical to say the least. After all, what kind of traveling trash merchant carries a genuine treasure map, for a few measly iron bits no less. Even if the map was real, I thought, what business do Amal and I have trekking through a burning desert to raid some poor soul's long-forgotten grave. But he's really come through this time; the map is in fact real and, remarkably, Amal has led us this far without incident. According to the map, it won't be more than a half day's journey to the place they once called the Valley of the Chosen, or so Amal says. I'm relying entirely on him as I cannot read the supposed ancient language the map is written in. How he can is beyond me.{^n}{^n}There are signs of a once mighty civilization everywhere. I've seen buildings, statues, tombs and temples. Some stand as if they were erected yesterday but most have fallen prey to the ravages that tore through this land long ago. If I didn't know better, I'd say the earth itself had reared up to lay waste to the structures built here, intentionally razing some and leaving others untouched. It is an unnerving thought, no doubt.{^n}{^n}I do not know what happened to this place, or to the people that must have inhabited it, or why no one has returned to reclaim it. Amal tells me stories of cataclysmic events, the roiling hot blood of the earth pouring over the land, unnatural beasts risen to exact the vengeful punishment of a scorned god. I honestly don't know if he's making it up to scare me or if he genuinely believes that's what happened here.{^n}{^n}In the end, all that matters is that everyone left in a hurry and they left a whole lot of valuables behind. If it is true, and it appears to be, this will be a very profitable journey after all.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (1/2)
tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_TombsNoteA05Text=Last night we reached the badlands around the Valley of the Chosen where we made camp along a jagged ridgeline. Just over the crest, as far as the eye could see, the harsh volcanic landscape was dotted with tomb entrances and monuments whose golden inlays sparkled in the bright moonlight; all of which were centered along a main corridor of grand burial crypts.{^n}{^n}It was an equally exhilarating and daunting sight as I was not looking forward to traversing volcanic rock and leaping over molten rivers. And I have to say there's been some strange goings-on as we draw nearer to our goal. This morning I could swear that the earth itself shook me awake and in the last fitful moments of sleep I dreamt of being consumed by fire, sinking deeper and deeper into an endless ocean of flame. As I jerked back to the realm of the waking I saw Amal sleeping like a freshly suckled pig, clutching his empty rum cask like the teat of a generous mother. It must have been in my head, perhaps an anxious dream brought on by the anticipation of the final leg of our journey and the riches that might be buried in the valley ahead.{^n}{^n}But later, as we broke camp, I noticed something very peculiar. We arrived last night well after sunset and I would have bet my life we made our camp at the foot of a massive statue. This morning, it was missing. I was dumbstruck. Not only was it gone but there were gargantuan footprints leading away from it like those of a man wearing heavy boots, only many times larger. They were deep and the stride was long as if the statue had just walked off in the night or some massive man had slung it over his shoulder and made off with it.{^n}{^n}When I told Amal he seemed surprised at first, but then brushed it off. He insisted there was no statue, that the full moon played a cruel trick on me. I think he saw it too, I'm certain of it, but he's so focused on finding treasure that he won't admit to any distractions.{^n}{^n}If that weren't enough, as we made our way down into the valley I could swear I saw an entire caravan of men and women dressed in long gray robes and heavy armor off in the distance. They were traveling northward along the ridgeline next to the tombs, chanting as they went. By the time I got Amal to stop gaping at the gold inlay on the temple door we were going to pry open, he missed seeing them entirely. I feel as though I'm losing my mind but I'm quite positive we are not alone here.{^n}{^n}I don't suppose it matters much at this point. We've reached our goal, the tomb marked on Amal's map is right beneath our feet. This one, among so many, supposedly holds grand riches. Perhaps once we're inside, I can breathe easy away from all the weirdness happening out here; if we can figure out how to get the damned thing open.{^n}{^n}                                                                       (2/2)
