Don't touch my stuff!
Okay... do you have any advice?

If your equipment is lacking, you can visit a faction vendor to buy some gear. It might be junk, but it's better than nothing!
Remember to keep your gear updated to survive the Eternal Arena.
If your faction level is too low, you should find a way to improve your reputation so you can invest in better gear!
I'm sorry, I don't have any faction gear to sell you... I only serve Priestess Luna and Lord Tallinn.
Farewell.
