Those who resisted the surge of Ch'thon worship, and nearly driven to extinction by it, Frigid Hunters are a rare band of Asterkarn outcasts living in seclusion and adhere to three strict tenets: swift, silent, and fatal. The bitter frost of Amatok are but a plaything to them, able to infuse their deadly arsenal with its bone-chilling cold or harness it into brutal winds. Heavy spears and massive long-ranged weapons are their favored tools of mercy, though their mastery of the cold can always make do with whatever weapon in their hands.^n^sCreated by Hill-op for the Swampdweller Mod.

tagHunterSkill08Description=^b[Player Scaled Pet] [Buff] [Debuff] [Aura] [Immobile]^n^n^wThe cold winds of Asterkarn is both the blessing of Amatok, as well as it's most deadly weapon. By it's will, conjure a burst of freezing cold winds at a target location.
