tagSkillClassDescription40=Foolish are those who dare brave the swamps and marshes of Cairn alone, for it is home to the ever-deadly Swampdwellers, humans with sadistic tendencies and an affinity for acid. Since the days of old, Swampdwellers have been known to have actively sealed pacts with wendigo spirits, causing them to become ruthless, animal-like monsters that can tear foes asunder while staying physically human. Those that do not create pacts with wendigo spirits tend to master the power contained within the swamp where they reside. They are able to combine alchemy and witchcraft to sprout sharp, poisonous plants in an instant, mutate nearby fauna to their will, or bend nature around them with vile acids and witchcraft.^n^sCreated by Hill-op for the Swampdweller Mod.

tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription01=^b[Spell] [Projectile] [Chaining]^n^n^wA simple, yet deadly means to quickly incapacitate a lost group of wanderers. Manipulate the air around you using wicked acids, allowing the vile liquid to float unnaturally in the air before sending it forward, bouncing toward other targets before returning to it's sender, ready to be reused again 
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription02=^b[Modifier]^n^n^wConcotion used is modified to alter the air it controls, making it as harsh as the air conditions in Ugdenbog, becoming much more lethal than before.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription03=^b[Modifier]^n^n^wChannel Solael's wrath into the whirling acid, infusing it with eldritch fire capable of disintegrating even steel into ash.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription04=^b[Spell] [Multiple Projectiles] [AOE]^n^n^wAn alchemical marvel developed by the ancient witches of East Marsh. When splashed on the ground, this concoction of acids and shards, imbued with eldritch powers, sprouts a mutated garden of vines resembling those summoned via shamanic practices. Different from its cousin however, these vines have thorns the shape of blades, akin to weapons used by the noble houses of Erulan, that impale those who are trapped in it and uses their blood to nourish their unnatural existence.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription05=^b[Modifier] [Secondary Modifier]^n^n^wDeadly fungi also sprout alongside the vines, ejecting spores that cause intense nausea and coat the thorns with venom deadly enough to knock giants unconscious.  
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription06=^b[Player Scaled Pet] [Trap] [Stationary]^n^n^wA cruel technique devised by the ex-necromancer Helgaritch of the Luminari during his research in Wightmire. In self-preservation against the Slith, he would trap nearby lesser souls, placing them in available vessels such as inanimate wood or a vial of acid to then be used as an emergency weapon he could control freely.^n^nThis particular technique is a modification of Helgaritch's method, trapping the soul in a quickly conjured, unstable plant growth created with witchcraft. As the plant is unnaturally created and inherently unstable, the plant withers extremely quickly, and the soul inside will burst to escape, exploding and spilling acid capable of melting flesh.^oThe flowers scale with player damage bonuses.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription07=^b[Pet Skill] [Modifier]^n^n^wThe unstable growth absorbs nutrients from its surrounding at a much faster rate, causing the already volatile plant to be dangerously unstable, making its eruption even more lethal. ^oThis skill only modifies Acidic Burst. 
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription08=^b[Pet Skill] [Nova] [AOE]^n^n^wCall upon the power of the Witch God, Bysmiel, infusing the growth with its power. this causes the plant to pulsate with waves of acid, weakening foes before it's inevitable eruption. 
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription09=^b[Buff] [Toggled] [Nova]^n^o[When HIt]^n^n^wMutate nearby fauna into living thorns and establish a symbiotic link with it. This allows their vines to attach to you, using your body as support. The thorns will readily strike back at anything should they be harmed.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription10=^b[Exclusive] [Buff]^n^n^wAttaining mastery over the powers that reside within the swamp is not an easy feat for any mere mortal. After tireless research and training, you finally obtained complete mastery over alchemy and witchcraft, and now the power to cause massive havoc within the blink of an eye is right at your fingertips. 
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription11=^b[Attack Replacer]^n^o[Melee]^n^n^wWhen a resident of the swamps first seals a pact with a wendigo spirit, a hunger, or perhaps bloodlust, rises within them, causing them to thirst for blood and crave flesh. A simple, yet effective method used to sate their newfound urges is to rip apart flesh and bone directly from their foes and devour them whole, whether they are beast or not. ^oWhen used as your default weapon attack, Devour replaces every second strike. Requires a melee weapon.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription12=^b[Modifier]^n^n^w^r"Why consume only one foe at a time, when you can feast upon your foes all at once?"
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription13=^b[Secondary Modifier] [Projectile] [Orbiting]^n^n^wThe wendigo spirit hungers for more. With each meal you consume, the wendigo spirit will also nibble at your food. As it is slowly consumed by the spirit, the flesh will circle around you, hitting anything indiscriminately.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription14=^b[Spell] [Nova] [AOE]^n^n^wWith the capability of quick regeneration, you burst open to release a flurry of bone spikes capable of impaling foes to their very core. Those impaled will have their soul slowly consumed by the wendigo, causing their body to bleed unconditionally until the wendigo spirit is sated.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription15=^b[Secondary Modifier] [Buff] [Timed]^n^n^wAs the wendigo spirit feasts upon your foes' souls, a portion of the energy consumed is given to you, empowering your reflexes beyond mortal means.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription16=^b[Attack] [Melee] [AOE]^n^o[Melee]^n^n^wMany tales tell are told of ravage swampdwellers, those who would eviscerate a person to eat their innards whole. Only some, however, would tell the tale of those who would kill a person in the blink of an eye, as if they intend to kill only for the thrill of it. These swampdwellers will assault their target like a wild animal, tearing them apart in a flash of gore and forbidden lightning. ^oRequires a melee weapon.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription17=^b[Modifier]^n^n^wAs you proceed to tear at your foe, your wendigo spirit will manifest itself in the form of deadly claws at your hand, allowing you to rip apart your foes with bestial fury.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription18=^b[Spell] [AOE]^n^n^wLet the primordial wendigo spirit gaze down upon the mortal plane, showering the location with deadly, corrosive blood. Those unfortunate enough to be in the downpour will have their skin and bones melt as they are slowly consumed by the primordial spirit.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription19=^b[Modifier]^n^n^wThe wendigo spirit consumes its targets ravenously, potentially causing the marked target's arteries to burst, replenishing the spirit's power faster, and in turn, empowering the shower of blood.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription20=^b[Exclusive] [Buff]^n^n^wA rite that only the most insane swampdweller will ever perform. Embrace your primal hunger, offering your soul to your bonded wendigo spirit, which will now inhabit your body, mutating it with inhuman strength and agility.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription21=^b[Buff] [Toggled]^n^n^wAllow yourself to forego ethics and morality, as you embrace your sadistic tendencies. ^r"Let blood spill forth as flesh collapses"
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription22=^b[Modifier]^n^n^w^r"Fresh blood tastes delicious! Seek more, and all the power you ever wanted shall be granted!"
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription23=^b[Buff] [Toggled] [Aura]^n^n^wOne of a swampdweller's most noticable characteristics is the "unique" stench that emanates from them. It is said that their "odor" is also capable of carrying deadly pathogens that live in the swamp. The swampdweller, however, feels nothing and appears to be resistant to these strains.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription24=^b[Modifier]^n^n^wDiseases and pathogens seem to mutate in the presence of a swampdweller, causing them to become very aggressive. These "things" will forcefully insert themselves into anything that they can touch, weakening them and making them ill.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription25=^b[Passive]^n^n^wAnyone who has ever met a swampdweller would probably describe their presence as, for a lack of a better word, dense. One research paper, published by people in the Vaults of the Luminari, explained that it was due to their symbiotic link with nearby fungi. These fungi will use the swampdweller to spread their spores, while in return, the fungi help them survive in the swamps by empowering them.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription26=^b[Passive]^n^n^wMutate your blood into deadly acid, capable of melitng through flesh and bone. When your blood is spilled, the acid spills forth, making your foes regret ever hitting you. 
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription27=^b[Passive]^n^o[On Crit]^n^n^wIt is not unusual for a dweller of the swamp to seek power without bargaining with the manipulative wendigo spirits. These swampdwellers seek power from one of the three Witch Gods, most often Solael. With a small fraction of his mastery of the Eldrtich Fire bestowed upon you, coat your arsenal with its taint, granting your armaments unstoppable power. ^oBlack Flashes will appear whenever you critically hit, destroying your enemies' resistance. This is a psuedo-buff and cannot be nullified.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription28=^b[Transmuter]^n^n^wThe mixture used inside the vial is increased exponentially, causing the impact zone to sprout a much bigger vine growth that hungers for more blood to sustain its uncontrollable hunger.
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription29=^b[Transmuter]^n^n^w^r"Give up your body and your flesh, and let me reside deep inside your mind, and you shall be granted infinite power!"
tagClassSwampdwellerSkillDescription30=^b[Transmuter] [Secondary Modifier]^n^o[On Attack]^n^n^wThose drenched by the "blood" of the primordial wendigo will fall into the grasp of its power, causing them to go mad and hunger for anything they can get immediately. Those affected will forgo any defensive measures and focus only on sating their hunger exclusively.
