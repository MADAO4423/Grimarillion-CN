Tallinn
Greetings! I see you've met Priestess Luna and... brought her here, along with her followers. Well, it's better than leaving her alone in her nightmare but at least I can be her champion once again.
I've heard a lot about you! What happened? How did you get here?
Ah, that's a complicated story. You found my note from the Loghorrean, so you know what happened there. As I was falling through realities, I felt a presence pull me here. {^n}{^n}I... I can't explain it more really. When I got here, I was alone - or so I thought. There has never been anyone here with me, physically. {^n}{^n}I think... when I was pulled here, the entity that created this domain also inhabited my form. I have unfamiliar thoughts and know things that I can't possibly know.
You know things? Like what?
This place - it's another one of the mysterious arenas in the Eternal Loop, however this one is different. It's called... Achalesas' Domain. {^n}{^n}I'm not sure how I know that, I just do. As I said I just know things, from a memory that isn't my own but is shared with me. Maybe it's Achalesas? Maybe it's something else entirely.
Okay... Can you tell me anything about the Eternal Loop? How can I help Luna escape?
*Priestess* Luna. {^n}{^n}How indeed. Well, the arena is not complete. You may have escaped the Precipice of Lunacy, but that is not the end of the loop. You must complete the trials of the arena. {^n}
Okay? So what's next? How far have you gotten?
I've delved pretty far into the trials, but I've hit my limit. What I can tell you is that you've only skimmed the surface of the trials by defeating the Loghorrean.{^n}{^n}We are counting on you now to free us from this loop, so just keep going. 
Just continue? I could be here forever trying to save you.
I think that is not the case though. I.. er.. I know it is not the case. There is an end to the madness. {^n}{^n}As I said, I've delved pretty far so I can tell you what I know. The Loghorrean symbolizes the first half of the first trial. You must complete that trial before you can progress.{^n}{^n}Following this trial, there is a trial to defeat the most notorious villains from each of the factions from your world. You may recognize them as your nemesis.{^n}{^n}And the final trial, you must defeat Celestial entities. These are challenging enemies that you probably won't be able to defeat easily.{^n}{^n}Once you complete the final trial... I believe the trials are complete, but what happens after I do not know.
Alright, I'll get to work on completing the trials then.
