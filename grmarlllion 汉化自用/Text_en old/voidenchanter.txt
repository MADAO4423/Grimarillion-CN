Alunar the Enchanter
Looking for magic?
Sure? Do you have any advice?

Your armor and weapons are incomplete without the right enchantments, don't forget to use them!
You will have better chances of surviving the Eternal Arena if you apply augments to your gear that will empower your skills.
If your faction level is too low, you should find a way to improve your reputation so you can invest in better enchantments!
I'm sorry, I don't have any enchantments to sell you, I only serve Priestess Luna and Lord Tallinn.
Farewell.
