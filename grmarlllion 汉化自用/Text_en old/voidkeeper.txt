Lord Ak'lorash, the Keeper of Knowledge
Greetings mortal...
Do you have any advice?

If you are struggling in the arena, you can visit a faction vendor to buy some blueprints. Use these blueprints to improve your power!
Remember to visit the blacksmith regularly to check on your new blueprints!
If your faction level is too low, you should find a way to improve your reputation so you can invest in better blueprints to craft!
I'm sorry, I don't have any blueprints to sell you... I only serve Priestess Luna and Lord Tallinn.
Farewell.
