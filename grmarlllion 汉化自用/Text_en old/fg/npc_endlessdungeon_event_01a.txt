Can I ask some questions first?
The Shattered Realm is as much a mystery to me as it is to you, but I'll answer what I can.
What is the Shattered Realm, exactly?
The Shattered Realm is unlike anything mankind has ever witnessed, teeming with wealth and power beyond imagining, but also dangers not unlike those that we face even now on Cairn. Whatever entity crafted this realm, it seems it has long vanished and, with its absence, the world crumbles.{^n}{^n}It is very much a reflection of our own physical reality, but broken and distorted. As far as I know, it continues forever, but as its light fades so the insatiable darkness consumes it. The deeper you dig, the more difficult the opposition may become.{^n}{^n}You may encounter powerful guardians of the realm that will seek to stop you, but should you triumph against them, vast wealth awaits!{^n}{^n}Upon entering the Shattered Realm, you will appear within a Shard. The way forward will only open once you've gathered enough Souls from its forsaken denizens. I shall keep the way open for you so that you can return during your current journey.
Open a new rift to the Shattered Realm!
Before we begin, I have a Waystone you can use.

Wait, I need some time to prepare.
How do the rewards work?
The Shattered Realm is protected by powerful guardians, many of whom will be reflections of mighty foes you may have faced here on Cairn. Should you vanquish them, I shall project myself before you.{^n}{^n}Then you will face a choice: delve deeper into this warped reality and face even greater threats for greater wealth, or claim anything the guardians you felled held dominion over.
Open a new rift to the Shattered Realm!
Before we begin, I have a Waystone you can use.

Wait, I need some time to prepare.
What if I wish to return deeper into the Shattered Realm at a later time?
Should you delve deep enough, you may eventually discover the means to create Waystones with the assistance of a Blacksmith.{^n}{^n}These fragments are a piece of the very realm you seek to explore and will allow me to open a portal into Shards deeper within.

Earn your place within our camp, and we can speak more of the Shattered Realm's mysteries.

Farewell.
How can I prove myself?
The Shattered Realm is not some playground. It carries great risks and I must know you are prepared.{^n}{^n}Speak to the Emissary, earn a right to battle alongside one of the cults gathered here, and we shall speak again.

Farewell.

We'll speak again.
Farewell.
