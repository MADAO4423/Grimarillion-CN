tagTallinnsNote=A note from Tallinn
tagTallinnsNoteDesc=To whomever finds this, the Eternal Arena does not end with the Loghorrean. It does not continue infinitely as we thought. The Loghorrean is merely a ... gatekeeper, it connects multiple domains and realms for other arenas. I defeated the beast, however in doing so, it retreated to another domain, and dragged me through multiple other domains until I crashed here... Hopefully my Priestess can find another champion to help her escape her torment...

tagLunasNote1=Eternal Voyage pt 1
tagLunasNote1Desc=As the quill glides across the parchment, the weight of my discoveries bears down upon me like the heavy shroud of night. These words may never see the light of day, but I must record the depths to which my experiments have plunged, the sacrifices made in pursuit of the forbidden. {^n}{^n}In the gloom of my sanctuary, where shadows dance like specters in the candlelight, I have delved into the darkest recesses of the occult. The ancient tomes, their pages brittle with age, have become my companions in this solitary journey. Each whispered incantation, each arcane symbol traced upon the air, draws me closer to the abyss that beckons from beyond the veil.{^n}{^n}I have shed blood upon the altar of my ambitions, offering up the lives of innocents in exchange for the keys to unlock the secrets of the cosmos. The echoes of their screams still haunt the chamber, a grim reminder of the cost of my obsession.{^n}{^n}But it is not merely power that drives me. No, it is the promise of discovery, of unlocking the mysteries that lie hidden within the folds of reality itself. I have glimpsed into eternity, shimmering like a mirage in the darkness, its tantalizing glow a beacon of hope amidst the encroaching shadows.{^n}{^n}With each sacrifice, with each drop of blood spilled upon the ancient sigils, the void draws closer to fruition. Soon, I shall stand upon the threshold of worlds, gaze into the abyss, and beckon forth the entity that dwells within.{^n}{^n}What wonders await beyond the rift, I dare not imagine. But I am prepared to face whatever horrors lie in wait, for the thirst for knowledge that consumes me knows no bounds.{^n}{^n}May the stars bear witness to my folly, and may the gods have mercy upon my soul.{^n}{^n}Luna

tagLunasNote2=Eternal Voyage pt 2
tagLunasNote2Desc=My Final Testament,{^n}{^n}As I pen these words, the air crackles with the electric tension of impending revelation. The riftgate stands before me, a swirling maelstrom of otherworldly energies beckoning me to step beyond the confines of this mortal realm. The time has come to cast aside the trappings of my humanity and embrace the boundless possibilities that lie beyond the veil.{^n}{^n}The pull of the rift is intoxicating, a siren's call that resonates deep within my soul. It whispers promises of untold power, of knowledge beyond comprehension, and of a destiny forged in the crucible of the cosmos. How can I resist such temptation, when the very fabric of reality trembles at my touch?{^n}{^n}The tunnel before me stretches into the abyss, a yawning chasm carved from the blackest obsidian and inscribed with chthonic sigils that writhe and twist like serpents in the gloom. Each step I take brings me closer to the brink, closer to the moment when I shall cast myself into the unknown and embrace the chaos that awaits.{^n}{^n}My companions in this mortal coil, know that I do not take this path lightly. Know that every sacrifice, every drop of blood spilled upon the altar of my ambition, has been for naught if not for the pursuit of truth. And so, I leave behind this testament as a reminder of the price one must pay for enlightenment, and as a warning to those who would dare to follow in my footsteps.{^n}{^n}As I step into the swirling vortex of the riftgate, I feel the last vestiges of my humanity slip away like sand through my fingers. In its place rises something primal and ancient, a force beyond comprehension that yearns to break free from the shackles of mortality.{^n}{^n}Farewell, my friends, and may the stars guide you on your journey. For I am no longer of this world, but a traveler amidst the infinite expanse of the cosmos.{^n}{^n}With trembling hand and steadfast heart,{^n}{^n}Luna
