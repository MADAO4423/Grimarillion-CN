tagDDSkillClassDescription01=Some followers of Uroboruuk study spiritual and flesh arts in different ways and often seem as "heretics" to members of Death Vigil. To the skilled Reanimator, death is but a threshold that may be crossed both ways, as they animate walking bones and spirits to fight back to back instead of hiding behind mindless abominations. Should the conjured dead not suffice, a Reanimator's affinity towards life allows them to claim it with their own hands and morbid spells.  ^n^sCreated by T3nd0 for the Darkest Dawn Mod, updated by Bane

tagDDSkillClassDescription02=Rumored to be a small sect within the Emperor's Nightblades, Illusionists are semi-mythical manipulators and puppetmasters. They kill not with a whirlwind of blades, but with a drop of rage directly instilled into a target's head, with paralysis, and with confusion. The battlefield is but a play waiting to be orchestrated, and the Illusionist's willpower determines the outcome. ^n^sCreated by T3nd0 for the Darkest Dawn Mod, updated by Bane
