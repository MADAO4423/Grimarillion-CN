Vanilla Class Descriptions (added credits)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

tagSkillClassDescription01=Soldiers of the imperial army were trained to survive in the most hellish conditions and hold the line against the deadliest enemies of the empire. Soldiers prefer the use of close combat weaponry, such as a sword and shield, but can also prove formidable with firearms. What a Soldier may lack in outright damage output is made up for in fortitude and leadership. ^n^sCreated by Crate Ent. for Grim Dawn

tagSkillClassDescription02=Pyrotechnic masters of the imperial army, Demolitionists are part engineer and part sorcerer. They were used to break enemy ranks and breach fortifications with their devastating array of explosives and destructive magic. They usually prefer to fight at range; engaging enemies with guns, traps and explosives but they can also be proficient with melee weapons. ^n^sCreated by Crate Ent. for Grim Dawn

tagSkillClassDescription03=Once hunted by imperial forces in an effort to control eldritch power, the Occultist's craft focuses heavily on summoning and borrowed powers granted by the three witch "gods" Bysmiel, Solael and Dreeg. Their diverse arts include abhorrent curses and spells that inflict damage with poison, acid, and entropic energy. Excelling with neither sword nor gun, they can use either to augment their offense. ^n^sCreated by Crate Ent. for Grim Dawn

tagSkillClassDescription04=Nightblades were clandestine warriors that sold their services to the great houses of the empire. Nightblades excel with all manner of martial weapons, but are even more feared for the deadly blade magic that is the secret of their trade. Nightblades are not suited to go toe to toe with tougher enemies and rely on illusion to close for quick, devastating attacks or fight from a distance with phantasmal blades. ^n^sCreated by Crate Ent. for Grim Dawn

tagSkillClassDescription05=To Arcanists, the manifestation of magic is not some unexplainable mystery or the will of the gods, but a science meant to be unraveled.  This pursuit of knowledge drives all Arcanists, always eager to discover a new technique to make their namesake.  Arcanists warp Aetherial and elemental energy to their will, creating devastating demonstrations of power that rival small armies.  However, such raw force leaves little in terms of defense. ^n^sCreated by Crate Ent. for Grim Dawn

tagSkillClassDescription06=Hailing from the untamed northlands, Shamans were the spiritual leaders and guardians of their people. Claiming an astounding attunement to the wilds and their patron deity Mogdrogen, Shamans are capable of wielding the terrible forces of nature against their foes or even calling upon savage beasts to come to their aid. Shamans excel in the use of brutal two-handed melee weapons, but can easily adapt to other tools of war when conjuring their primal powers. ^n^sCreated by Crate Ent. for Grim Dawn

tagSkillClassDescription07=As members of the esteemed Luminari Order, Inquisitors were responsible for protecting the Erulan Empire from the dangers of the arcane and the occult. Over the centuries, the Inquisitors gathered countless relics of unimaginable power, but duty sometimes overcomes safety, and some of these relics were studied and in turn replicated for use by the inquisition. While they excel with ranged weapons, Inquisitors are armed with an arsenal of relics and arcane runes that allow them to be more than capable in close-quarters combat. ^n^sCreated by Crate Ent. for Grim Dawn

tagSkillClassDescription08=Though most modern Necromancers hail from the Order of Death's Vigil and the training of the mysterious Uroboruuk, not all choose the secluded life. While their profession naturally inspires fear and revulsion, the Necromancers of Cairn seek balance through research and mastery over the ultimate fate that awaits all mortals: death. Necromancers make heavy use of conjuring forth skeletal minions and sapping the very vitality from their unwary foes, though entering the fray themselves with martial weapons is not unheard of. ^n^sCreated by Crate Ent. for Grim Dawn

tagSkillClassDescription09=Whether they hail from the Temple of Menhir, or offer their souls to the Witch Gods, all Oathkeepers have two things in common: unflinching loyalty and zealous fury. Oathkeepers are the guardians of sacred tombs, keepers of the faithful and ardent enforcers of celestial will. They do not merely hide behind a shield or their divine powers; to Oathkeepers, these are weapons upon which they shall spill the blood of the unworthy and exact their righteous wrath. ^n^sCreated by Crate Ent. for Grim Dawn

tagGrimar_TutorialTip1Title=∙Grimarillion Guide 003: Corrupt Totems

tagGrimar_TutorialTip1SubTitleA=^nCorrupt Totems
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextA=^nIn your adventures you may come across some dangerous Monster Totems, but occasionally, these totems can be corrupted by the minions of Hell. This is totally random, and doesn't happen every time you find a totem in this location. When this happens, you will have a grueling fight ahead of you if you decide to purge the totem. These totems do not need to be cleansed, so if you're worried you're not up for the challenge - that's okay. You can always wait until you're comfortable with your power level to challenge these hellfiends. 



tagGrimar_TutorialTip1SubTitleB=^nMinions of Hell
(image of the map icons and shrine icons)
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextB=^nAbove are the icons for the Corrupt Totems, with slightly different coloring depending on the boss who corrupts the totem (other than the Diablo and Malthael icons). If you activate one of these totems you will run into one of the powerful minions of Hell. ^n^nHere is a list of them:
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextC=^n∙Adria : A powerful blood witch corrupted by the temptation of power. She can deal a wide variety of damage types such as physical, chaos, vitality, bleeding, and elemental.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextD=^n∙Azmodan : A lesser Evil, the Lord of Sin. He deals physical, chaos and fire damage.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextE=^n∙Belial : A lesser Evil, the Lord of Lies. He deals aether and acid damage.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextF=^n∙The Butcher : A masochistic demon who relishes in tearing the flesh from his foes and devouring their meat. He deals physical, fire, and bleeding damage.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextG=^n∙The Cow King : King of the Hell Bovine, the Cow King was given sentience by Diablo and driven mad by the heroes of Tristram. He deals physical, elemental, and bleeding damage.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextH=^n∙Diablo : One of the Prime Evils, the Lord of Terror. Diablo is capable of dealing physical, chaos, and fire damage.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextI=^n∙Leoric : A king from a lost kingdom, he was corrupted by Diablo's temptations of power. He deals physical, cold, and vitality damage.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextJ=^n∙Malthael : The Angel of Death, corrupted by a Black Soulstone. He deals a wide variety of damage types such as physical, fire, cold, chaos, vitality, and aether
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextK=^n∙Tyrael : The Angel of Justice, fallen from grace. He deals physical and elemental damage.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextL=^n∙Zoltun Kulle : A powerful horadrim corrupted by the temptation of power. He can deal physical, fire, and elemental damage.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip1TextM=^n^n

tagGrimar_TutorialTip2Title=∙Grimarillion Guide 005: Eternal
tagGrimar_TutorialTip2TextA=^nIf you head southeast from the Devil's Crossing riftgate, you will stumble across some rickety stairs. Down the stairs, past the personal hideout rowboat, you'll find a mysterious agent and a demolished shack. Enter the ruins of the shack to find yourself in-between worlds, a ruined cellar floating in the abyss. Continue through the ruins, and you'll find a portal which will take you into the Precipice of Lunacy, a lost domain. In this new area you will find many NPC's and an arena. The arena will not activate until you speak to Priestess Luna and approach the gate. 

tagGrimar_TutorialTip2SubTitleB=^nThe Arena
tagGrimar_TutorialTip2TextB=^nJust beyond the obsidian gate, you'll find a large obsidian arena, and a summoning stone. Speak with the summoning stone to begin your participation in the Eternal Arena. As you progress through this trial by combat, you'll come across nearly every enemy you can encounter in Grim Dawn, and they will drop their loot. So this means you can farm all the game's MI in one spot. In addition you'll be rewarded with iron bits, experience, and eternal shards for completing waves. You'll get more rewards the better you perform, so try your best!

tagGrimar_TutorialTip2SubTitleC=^nServices
tagGrimar_TutorialTip2TextC=^nWithin this hellscape you can find several helpful people in the safe area to aid you in your attempt to clear the Eternal waves. You have Narisk the Alchemist who can convert your eternal shards into various goodies, you have Priestess Luna who can grant faction rewards, devotion points, player levels, iron bits and other things. And beyond these two NPCs, you have a collection of other faction NPCs, crafters, caravans, and so on.

tagGrimar_TutorialTip3Title=∙Grimarillion Guide 097: Events
tagGrimar_TutorialTip3TextA=^nOccasionaly ASYLUM101 spends too much of his freetime adding fun little events and minigames into Grimarillion. At the time of writing this, there was an active Winter Event, which involved chasing down loot gnomes for their gingerbread which you could use to purchase various goodies, such as items and pets! Previously we had a Halloween Event where pumpkin monsters invaded Cairn and dropped candies for you to buy pets and items.

tagGrimar_TutorialTip4Title=∙Grimarillion Guide 002: Grimmest
tagGrimar_TutorialTip4TextA=^nGrimmest is a dynamic difficulty system that can make the game harder or simply more fun. If you believe you have a build strong enough to entertain a higher challenge, visit the Personal Hideout and look for Zeke, the Heavy Metal Enthusiast, who should be very near the riftgate. He will give two options, to adjust Hero Rate or Density - Hero Rate will increase how many heroes you encounter, which could make the game very difficult, and Density will simply double the amount of monsters you find. Note: You can only double density ONCE. You can't increase the mobs past 2x.

tagGrimar_TutorialTip4SubtitleB=^nHero Rate

tagGrimar_TutorialTip6Title=∙Grimarillion Guide 004: Item Swapper
tagGrimar_TutorialTip6TextA=^nIn the heart of the Personal Hideout, you will find a strange man and an even stranger device. Magnusson, the Artificer is able to some of the vanilla items and replace them with mod variants. There are several legendary items that are included in this, but primarily this includes Monster Infrequents. Better still - unlike Tendo, the Replica Smith, these MIs will not only be replaced with the variant, but they will retain all their affixes so you won't lose your perfectly affixed gear! When you swap a vanilla item into a D3 item, it becomes "Hellforged", a Darkest Dawn item becomes a "Replica", and a Priest item becomes "Reverent". See below for the lists of swappable items:

tagGrimar_TutorialTip7Title=∙Grimarillion Guide 006: SR Modifications
tagGrimar_TutorialTip7TextA=^nGrimarillion at it's heart, is an expansion of Grim Dawn and intends to give freedom where possible. The Shattered Realm is no exception, and ASYLUM101 did what he could to open this mode up a little. When you speak to Mazaan to delve into the Shattered Realm, you have two new options if you play Grimarillion. You can use a Loot Stone, or an Arena Stone. These two stones will replace the existing Shattered Realm with a new one that is *slightly* different.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip7SubtitleB=^nLoot Stone: 
tagGrimar_TutorialTip7TextB=^nUsing this stone allows the player to dive into Shattered Realm and loot the enemies who spawn there, including any potential MI that they may have equipped.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip7SubtitleC=^nArena Stone:
tagGrimar_TutorialTip7TextC=^nUsing this stone allows the player to fight only boss chunks in the Shattered Realm, effectively turning it into a Boss Rush mode.

tagGrimar_TutorialTip8Title=∙Grimarillion Guide 007: Reskill
tagGrimar_TutorialTip8TextA=^nIn the mod crafter section of the Personal Hideout you'll discover Infernus, the Runecarver.

Image (Show infernus' location)

tagGrimar_TutorialTip8SubtitleB=^nInfernus, the Runecarver
tagGrimar_TutorialTip8TextB=^nInfernus is the Reskill Gem crafter. If you provide Infernus with a weapon that has a granted skill that you want to use, but you don't want it that weapon... Infernus can create a Skill Rune from that weapon.

Image (show an image of the crafting screen)

tagGrimar_TutorialTip8TextC=^nSkill Runes serve as versatile components that can be very powerful, but they will require you to make a sacrifice and destroy one the item that has the granted skill you want. In addition, some of these Skill Runes are limited to which item slots they can be applied to.

tagGrimar_TutorialTip9Title=∙Grimarillion Guide 008: Grim Armory
tagGrimar_TutorialTip9Subtitle=^nMain Gameplay Features:
tagGrimar_TutorialTip9TextA=^nGrim Armory introduces a large number of Legendary items to the game, currently in the form of item sets, but individual, standalone items are a possibility in the future. These items are designed and balanced around the vanilla Grim Dawn experience, and should land within the curve of Grim Dawn's power scaling, so as not to feel like "modded power creep".

image (show crafter)

tagGrimar_TutorialTip9TextB=^n^nThe Augury feature allows users to target-farm a wider array of items, including all of the new items introduced by the mod. When players reach Honored Faction rank with any of the endgame Factions (Black Legion, Malmouth Resistance, Witch Covens), they may purchase a "Mysterious Card" that allows them to summon an NPC who will convert Augury Cards into items. Augury Cards drop from specific enemies throughout the world, and behave like Partial Components, requiring players to get enough of a certain card to create a Completed Component which can be converted into a usable item at the Augury Smith NPC.

image (show card)

tagGrimar_TutorialTip10Title=∙Grimarillion Guide 009: Crusader Weapons
tagGrimar_TutorialTip10TextA=^nThe Diablo 3 mod offers a unique way to equip two-handed weapons in ONE hand. Keep in mind, this isn't a global passive that works with all two handers, only special Crusader-styled weapons that you can craft from Haedrig, at the Personal Hideout. 

Image (Show the crusader weapons in the blacksmith inventory, have one selected so the 10k physique requirement is visible)

tagGrimar_TutorialTip10TextB=^nOnce you obtain a Crusader weapon, you'll notice the exceptionally high stat requirement. 10,000 Physique??? How can anyone possibly equip this?! Well, Haedrig tells you exactly how if you view his crafting table:

Image (Show the Haedrig tooltip)

tagGrimar_TutorialTip10TextC=^nTo equip a Crusader weapon, you need to have the Crusader mastery, and the Hold Your Ground skill must be maxed out (10/10). Now the final and simplest step: Equip a shield! Once you fulfill all these requirements, the Crusader weapon can be equipped!

image (Show the Hold your ground skill at 10/10)


tagGrimar_TutorialTip11Title=∙Grimarillion Guide 010: Mod Currencies
tagGrimar_TutorialTip11TextA=^nIn Grimarillion, some of the mods have their own currency types that can drop randomly, mostly from heroes and bosses but you can rarely find them from other places as well. Whenever a constitution item drops in Grimarillion, it triggers a script and this script will basically roll a dice for you to determine A) should a currency drop and then B) which currency should be dropped. At the time of writing this guide, there are 3 currencies.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip11SubtitleA=^nTypes of Currency:
tagGrimar_TutorialTip11TextB=^nForgotten Souls:^n^nThis currency is used for crafting various Diablo 3 items by visiting Haedrig in the Personal Hideout. You can use these souls to convert weapons into Crusader Variants, Kanai Cubes, and even gamble them for random unique Diablo 3 equipment.

Image (show icon) 

tagGrimar_TutorialTip11TextC=^nElectrum Coins:^n^nThis currency is used for crafting various Titan Quest items by visiting Pelanis in the Personal Hideout. You can use these coins to craft artifacts, rare equipment for filling build holes, or even gamble them for random unique Titan Quest equipment.

Image (show icon) 

tagGrimar_TutorialTip11TextD=^nZenitham:^n^nThis currency is used for crafting various Zenith items by visiting The Incarnate in the Personal Hideout. You can use zenitham to craft upgradable relics and rare equipment for Zenith classes.

Image (show icon)

tagGrimar_TutorialTip11TextE=^nIn addition, Zenith gear also uses other materials that must be crafted from Zenitham, each one is associated with one of the 6 Zenith classes.

tagGrimar_TutorialTip12Title=∙Grimarillion Guide 098: FAQ
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12SubtitleA=^nWill I ever get in trouble for using a mod?
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12TextA=^nNo! Use as many mods as you want! Use rainbow mod, dpyes, grimarillion - knock yourself out.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12SubtitleB=^nI keep crashing, what can I do?
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12TextB=^nMake sure you have AOM (Ashes of Malmouth) and FG (Forgotten Gods) installed and fully updated. Not doing so can result in crashes or weird bugs.^n^n* Make sure you have the most recent version of Grimarillion installed, FRESH. Delete the old mod folder for grimarillion and install the newest version, just to be sure nothing is wrong.^n*Make sure you try both versions of Grim Dawn if one is crashing for you; if 64bit is crashing, try 32bit.^n*If it continues to crash, try to test without playing Grimarillion, just play vanilla. If there is no crash, we know it is something from Grimarillion.^n*Try to find a way to replicate the crash 100% without fail, if we know exactly what causes the crash we can try to fix it.^n*Disable Auto-Item Tooltips, unfortunately this can cause crashes for some people, not sure why but... try it out if you're crashing.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12SubtitleC=^nI'm trying to craft an item, but the button doesn't seem to do anything! Now nothing else will craft!
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12TextC=^nOn rare occasion, there are items that have a lower level limit and if you attempt to craft an item when you're below this limit, nothing will be crafted. You just need to level up more and try again. Diablo 3 items have this issue and the crafter will specifically say what level you should be.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12SubtitleD=^nMultiplayer doesn't seem to work right! 
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12TextD=^nSadly this is out of our control as modders, so if you must play multiplayer, just keep that in mind. The best thing you can do is to let the host manage all quest interactions and special NPC interactions. Try swapping hosts if it doesn't work in one configuration, maybe another will be better. 
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12SubtitleE=^nThis mod is awesome, where can I talk to other people about it? Where can I find builds?
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12TextE=^nGrimarillion has a small community you can find on the official Grim Dawn forums: https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/rel-grimarillion-v93/46587^nAs well as a community on Discord:https://discord.com/invite/GNqqDUz
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12SubtitleF=^nI think I found a bug, where can I report it?
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12TextF=^nYou can report bugs on the official Grimarillion nexus page, or the forum page mentioned above. There's also a dedicated bug-report section on the Discord. Just try to be as specific as possible.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12SubtitleG=^nMy UI is too big! I can'ta see! How can I make it smaller?
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12TextG=^nSadly, the only real option you have is to lower your resolution and UI scaling. 
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12SubtitleH=^nMy UI is too small! I have so many items!
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12TextH=^nYou have a few options available, you can sell gear, dismantle gear (Inventor NPC), or transmute gear (Inventor NPC). If that's not what you want, and you really wanna hoard your gear, you can look into third-party options, such as GDStash or GD Item Assistant. Grimarillion is not guaranteed to work with these all the time, so you use at your own risk and consult other players or the developers of those tools for any help you may need, please do not bother ASYLUM101 with any questions you have about these tools.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12SubtitleI=^nIs there a way I can calculate my DPS or something? Like a DPS meter?
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12TextI=^nAnother third-party option is DPYes, which among many many other features, has a DPS meter.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12SubtitleJ=^nWhat's the best build? I only play the best builds.
tagGrimar_TutorialTip12TextJ=^nOnce you get a feel of the mechanics and gameplay, you can discover the synergies that help give your builds the tools they need to succeed at any level!
