tagJackolanternNoteTitle2=^oThe Pumpkin Prank
tagJackolanternNoteTitle3=^oThe Spiraling Vine

tagJackolanternNote1=An innocent prank, or so we thought at first. However... the decorated pumpkins multiplied. We thought maybe someone was having fun, just putting out some jack-o-lantern's to decorate our little Homestead, trying to lift our spirits in these dark times. ^n^n1 pumpkin...^n2 pumpkins...^n4 pumpkins...^n^nSoon enough we were throwing them out because there was so many. We even sent some to Devil's Crossing. Where are they coming from? We've had a few meetings and no one knows. When no one is looking, a new one appears, as if from nothing.^n^nOne of the patrols mentioned seeing some out in the pumpkin fields nearby as well, so it's not just the town, though I'm not sure if we should feel relieved or not.^n^nIs it an omen? ^n^nWhatever it is - it feels like they are watching us...

tagJackolanternNote2=God damnit, is this some kind of sick joke? We ask the folks over at Homestead to send us food and what do they send? ^nJack-o'-Lanterns?? ^nThese aren't even edible! The hell are we supposed to do with these things? These pumpkins are empty inside, no meat whatsoever and the husk is hard like a rock. Can't believe they sent this here... ^n^nIf we weren't so busy with trying to survive, we should go over there and kick someone's ass for this prank! Wasting food like this... 

tagJackolanternNote3=Date: October 31^nLocation: Homestead Pumpkin Field^nShift: 1200 - 2300 ^n^n 1200-1600:^nWe've been talking - the other guards and myself. We've noticed the pumpkins, where they are coming from. It's in the field, there's somethign weird going on. We drew straws and it looks like I'll be investigating tonight. 1700:^nThe field wall was broken, so I walked in to check out the source of these jack-o'-lanterns but... something isn't right. The lanterns were watching me at the field wall, actually watching me. I felt their gaze as I walked by, their pumpkin forms turning to keep watch as I approached. I entered the field anyway, and... it's surreal. Some other people must have been drawn into this area as well, there are blood stains and bones everywhere, saturated into the soil, under rocks - everywhere. Stranger still, there is a pumpkin vine here but it seems to grow up from under a rock and spiral outwards, I've never seen a pumpkin vine shaped into a spiral but there it is. ^n^n1900: I've been inspecting the field for 2 hours now and I've noticed more pumpkins appearing around me, as if growing from the vine and watching me. They're actually moving! I decided to barricade the wall as best I could, but I don't think it will stop them. I think if someone doesn't do something, this could be bad, but I don't think I will be any help, judging by how these lanterns are staring at me...
