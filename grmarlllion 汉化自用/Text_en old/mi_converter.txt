Magnusson
"Ah, a curious one, I see. Allow me to introduce myself, I am Magnusson - an artificer, a craftsman of the esoteric, a weaver of the improbable. Using my Eldritch Loom, I tap into the hidden threads of reality - snagging echoes of what could have been and forging them into what now is.{^n}{^n}Your weapon, your armor, your trinkets... they exist in countless variations across the strands of fate. I can pluck these echoes from the void, shape them, and present you with a different incarnation - stronger, stranger, perhaps even more fitting for your path. But be warned... once changed, there is no turning back.{^n}{^n}So, tell me, traveler... shall we reshape destiny?"
Eldritch Loom?
"Ah, the Eldritch Loom? A marvel of engineering! It doesn't just alter objects - it reshapes their very potential. Every item exists in countless variations across infinite possibilities. With the right application of ley-line harmonics and a touch of forbidden theory, I can nudge reality itself to bring forth a different form."{^n}{^n}"Does it make sense? No? Good! That means it's working. Now, shall we see what the Loom can do for you?"
Right...

Uh, okay, sounds good!

Other Info
Not all MIs are supported, and not all mods have MI swaps. Currently you can choose Diablo 3, Darkest Dawn, Priest, or SwampMod swaps.{^n}{^n}Impotant Note:{^n}Diablo 3 swaps have some crossover with Priest, but will prioritize Bloodknight if there are conflicts.{^n}Priest swaps have some crossover with Diablo 3, but will prioritize Priest if there are conflicts.{^n}Once swapped, the items cannot be swapped back.{^n}{^n}After swapping, you must interact again to swap another item.
How will I know which items are supported?
Check your Codex for the Grimarillion Guide, it should be there.
Oh, okay.

I see.
