Narisk the Alchemist
Potions!
What? Do you have any advice for me?

Don't forget to craft tinctures and oils to improve your chances in the Eternal Arena.
Remember to use the proper potions to survive the Eternal Arena.
If your faction level is too low, you should find a way to improve your reputation so you can invest in better potions!
I'm sorry, I don't have any potions to sell you traveler... my potions are much too strong for you.
Farewell.
